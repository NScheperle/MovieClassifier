00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,708
<i>From the silence</i>

2
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,347
<i>From the night</i>

3
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,722
<i>Comes a distant</i>

4
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,854
<i>Lullaby</i>

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,363
<i>Soul
Surrendering your soul</i>

6
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,963
<i>The heart in you not whole</i>

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,771
<i>For love</i>

8
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:48,246
<i>For love</i>

9
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:57,187
<i>Walked out</i>

10
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:02,661
<i>Cast into the dark</i>

11
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:11,729
<i>Branded with a mark</i>

12
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,605
<i>Of shame</i>

13
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:21,238
<i>Of Cain </i>

14
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,046
<i>If I could just go back.</i>

15
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,554
<i>If I could rub everything out,</i>

16
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,682
<i>starting with myself.</i>

17
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,289
<i>Starting with borrowing a jacket.</i>

18
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,094
<i>Oh, such fleeting paradise</i>

19
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,796
<i>Such innocent delight</i>

20
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:49,399
<i>To love</i>

21
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,309
<i>Be loved</i>

22
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:57,213
<i>A lullaby</i>

23
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:06,589
<i>Then silence</i>

24
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,226
- Frances, that was lovely.
- I'm so glad. Thank you.

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,063
Congratulations.

26
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,798
Marvelous. Most enjoyable.

27
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,363
Herbert Greenleaf.
My wife, Emily.

28
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,874
Thank you. Tom Ripley.

29
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,274
- How do you do?
- You were at Princeton.

30
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,246
Most likely you'll know our son, Dick.
Dickie Greenleaf.

31
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,248
<i>I couldn't help noticing your jacket.</i>

32
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,079
Yes.

33
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,212
Class of '56.

34
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,121
How is Dickie?

35
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,557
<i>We've enjoyed meeting you.</i>

36
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,152
I do hope that you'll come out
and see us.

37
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,221
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Both of you.

38
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,427
- Herbert?
- Yes, yes. I very much hope so.

39
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,699
Of course, Dickie's idea of music is jazz.

40
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,104
- Oh, dear.
- He has a saxophone.

41
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,167
To my ear, jazz is just noise.

42
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,337
Just an insolent noise.

43
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,382
- Very nice to meet you.
- And you.

44
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,383
- Sir.
- We'll see you at the shipyard.

45
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,385
- I hope to.
- Good.

46
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,252
I have to run!
I'm very late!

47
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,084
- Ah, you were great!
- You were great.

48
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,858
Darling couple, aren't they?

49
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,958
Yes, they are.
Exceptional young man.

50
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,434
- Thanks a lot for the jacket.
- Thanks for filling in for me.

51
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,599
Take care of that wrist.
Bye, Fran.

52
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,117
Believe me.
Buy I.B.M. now, before it splits.

53
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,119
You'll make yourself a fortune.

54
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,121
You think so?

55
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,326
Sorry. Sorry.

56
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,362
Sorry.

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,797
<i>You've probably heard Dickie's
been living in Italy.</i>

58
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,563
Mongibello. South of Naples.

59
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,867
No kind of place at all.

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,873
- Good morning, sir.
- Frank.

61
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,274
Marge, his young lady,

62
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,539
is supposedly writing
some kind of book.

63
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,547
God only knows what he does.

64
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,642
By all accounts, they spend the whole time
on the beach or in a sailboat.

65
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,177
That's my son's talent--
spending his allowance.

66
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,589
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom?

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,993
Persuade my son to come home?

68
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,432
<i>I'd pay you...</i>

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,435
a thousand dollars.

70
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,266
Well, I have always wanted
to go to Europe, sir, but--

71
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,210
Good. Now you can go for a reason.

72
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,028
Count Basie.

73
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,362
<i>Duke Ellington? I don't know.</i>

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,736
I don't know.

75
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,971
I don't know.

76
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,413
Dizzy Gillespie.

77
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,920
<i>My funny Valentine</i>

78
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,852
My funny Valentine.

79
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:01,155
<i>Sweet, funny Valentine</i>

80
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,957
I don't even know
if this is a man or a woman.

81
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,083
Charlie Parker?

82
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,017
Charlie Parker.
I know it. It's Bird.

83
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,852
Yes!

84
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,342
- Here. I'll take it.
- Thanks.

85
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,545
That thousand bucks should come in handy.

86
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,588
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get that.

87
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,890
- Thank you.
- Sir. You're gonna have a great trip.

88
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,865
<i>Mr. Greenleaf is personal friends
with the Cunard people.</i>

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,342
I can tell you, the Greenleaf name
opens a lot of doors.

90
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,215
- <i>Do you speak English?</i>
- <i>What you name, please?</i>

91
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,548
- <i>Ripley.</i>
- <i>Follow me. No problem.</i>

92
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,521
- Here, Signor Ripley.
- Okay.

93
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,625
Uh, there. That one.

94
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,786
- This one.
- Wait, is that all? Count them.

95
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,990
<i>Attenzione.</i>
Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley?

96
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,330
- <i>Si.</i>
- <i>Attenzione.</i>

97
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,217
- What's your secret?
- Excuse me?

98
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,414
No, it's just that--
You <i>are</i> American, aren't you?

99
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,582
No, it's just that--

100
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:50,220
I have so much luggage,
and you're so, um, streamlined.

101
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,662
It's, you know, humiliating.

102
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,766
I'm Meredith, by the way.

103
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:01,397
- Hello, I'm Dickie.
- Meredith Randall.

104
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:04,567
- Um, Dickie Greenleaf.
- Hello.

105
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,570
You're not the shipping Greenleafs.

106
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,013
Oh, trying not to be.

107
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,744
Trying to jump ship.

108
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:17,345
So, uh, did they put
your cases in the wrong pile?

109
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:21,518
It's just that, uh,
you were in the "R" stand.

110
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:25,757
I thought I saw you there.

111
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,799
My father wants me back in New York.

112
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,665
He builds boats.
I'd rather sail them.

113
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:34,296
So I travel under my mother's name.

114
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:37,773
- Which is--
- Emily.

115
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:40,037
I'm just kidding.

116
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,541
You know, the funny thing is,

117
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,106
I'm not Randall either.

118
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,219
I'm Logue.

119
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:52,313
- As in--
- As in the textile Logues.

120
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,188
Trying to shrug off the dress.

121
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,387
- I travel under my mother's name too.
- Randall.

122
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,396
Right.

123
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:02,558
- So, Rome, Rome, Rome.
- Oh.

124
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,968
- We're partners in disguise. Bye.
- Bye.

125
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:27,280
<i>"The fiancée has a face."</i>

126
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,601
<i>Bird.</i>

127
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,809
<i>"This is my face."</i>

128
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,086
<i>So I guess you didn't look
at my new chapter.</i>

129
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,213
I will, Marge. I promise.

130
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,223
It's just been too hot.

131
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,694
If I make dinner at my place tonight,
maybe you could look at it then.

132
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,102
Dickie Greenleaf?

133
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,540
- Who's that?
- It's Tom. Tom Ripley.

134
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,474
Tom Ripley?

135
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:04,072
- We were at Princeton together.
- <i>Okay.</i>

136
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,946
Did we know each other?

137
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,680
Hello.
Well, I knew you, so...

138
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,745
I suppose you must have known me.

139
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,258
Princeton's like a fog.

140
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:18,762
America's like a fog.

141
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,163
This is Marge Sherwood.
Tom-- Sorry, what is it?

142
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,723
- Ripley.
- <i>How do you do?</i>

143
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,168
How do you do, Marge?

144
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,365
- What are you doing in Mongi?
- Nothing.

145
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,374
Nothing much.

146
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,774
<i>Just passing through.</i>

147
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:37,110
- Passing through?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

148
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,115
You're so white.

149
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,046
Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge?

150
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,113
Gray, actually.

151
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,681
It's just an undercoat.

152
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,355
- <i>Say again?</i>
- You know, a primer.

153
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,631
That's funny.

154
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,602
<i>Margie likes that 'cause
she's so white too.</i>

155
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,763
Yes, I do, and you're not funny.

156
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,773
You should come and have lunch with us
before you go.

157
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,605
- Yes, Dickie?
- <i>Sure, anytime.</i>

158
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,111
Well,

159
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,114
coincidence.

160
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,851
I don't remember him.

161
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:20,059
That's so funny.

162
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,328
Silvana! Hey!

163
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,302
I've been looking all over for you.

164
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,236
<i>Where've you been hiding?</i>

165
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,207
Today you're looking for me.
Where've you been the rest of the week?

166
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,643
You're always working.
Come on. Get on.

167
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,510
<i>With the American girl?</i>

168
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,516
- Hold on to me.
- I hate you.

169
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:49,247
- <i>Huh?</i>
- <i>I hate you!</i>

170
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,857
<i>Did you suddenly forget where I lived?</i>

171
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,086
I know. I'm late. I'm a swine.

172
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,094
- It's 4:00.
- I just woke up.

173
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,630
- Ohh.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,394
- You just woke up.
- Fausto and I took the boat out.

175
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,097
We were fishing, and then it was dawn,
and we caught absolutely nothing.

176
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:10,335
Mmm, yes, well,
we ate everything without you.

177
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,536
- We?
- Yes.

178
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,512
- Tom Ripley's here.
- Who?

179
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,814
- Tom. Hello.
- <i>Hi.</i>

180
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,377
- Hello.
- How are you? Thought you'd disappeared.

181
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,390
- We were gonna send out a search party.
- <i>No.</i>

182
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,656
- No, still here.
- Tom was telling me about his journey.

183
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,722
<i>Made me laugh so hard
I almost got a nosebleed.</i>

184
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,395
- Is that good?
- Shut up.

185
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

186
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,101
I'm despicable. But I love you.

187
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,111
- <i>Do you love me? Do you love me?</i>
- I'm intruding.

188
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,670
Can you mix a martini?

189
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,012
- Sure.
- I'll do it.

190
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,022
- Ohh.
- I make a fabulous martini.

191
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:06,195
Everybody should have one talent.
What's yours?

192
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,358
Forging signatures,

193
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,493
telling lies,
impersonating practically anybody.

194
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,666
That's three.
Nobody should have more than one talent.

195
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,005
<i>Okay, do an impression.</i>

196
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,602
- Now?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,774
The only talent my son has...

198
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,284
<i>is for cashing his allowance.</i>

199
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,820
- What?
- Oh, I like to sail.

200
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,790
Believe me, I love to sail.

201
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,850
- Instead, I make boats.
- <i>Stop!</i>

202
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,294
- <i>Other people sail them.</i>
- It's too much!

203
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,354
You're making all the hairs
on my neck stand up.

204
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,833
Oh, yes. Jazz.
Oh, jazz. Let's face it.

205
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,463
It's just, uh--
It's just insolent noise.

206
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,530
I feel like he's here.

207
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,044
- Horrible, like the old bastard's here.
- Good.

208
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,976
That's brilliant.

209
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,743
Brilliant!
How do you know him?

210
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,613
Oh, I met him in New York.

211
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,915
Marge!
Marge, this is scary.

212
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,285
You've got to hear this.
Meet my father,

213
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,551
Herbert Richard Greenleaf I.

214
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,527
Pleasure to meet you.
Dickie's made a fine catch.

215
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,121
- Uncanny!
- I know Emily thinks so.

216
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,462
- I don't get it.
- It's uncanny.

217
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,662
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom,

218
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,672
<i>and, uh, bringing him back?</i>

219
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,935
- What?
- I'd pay you.

220
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,943
If you would go to Italy,

221
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,970
persuade my son to come home,
I'd pay you a thousand dollars.

222
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,642
<i>I'm never going back.</i>

223
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,416
To actually hire somebody
to come all the way here...

224
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,423
to drag me back home--

225
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,618
Got to be a little insane,
doesn't he?

226
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,218
<i>Ciao,</i> Fausto.

227
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,701
- This is Tom.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Tom.

228
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,496
- I'm never going back.
- No, I think--

229
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,542
Your mother, her illness,
I think that's--

230
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,703
It's got nothing to do
with my mother.

231
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,442
She's had leukem--
This is what makes me boil about him.

232
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,111
He wants me back.
He wants me back.

233
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:10,552
- It's got nothing to do with my mother.
- Look, I don't know--

234
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,556
Go back.
Go back to New York.

235
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,683
Or call him,
if you can find a telephone that works,

236
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,298
and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
back to him or his shipyard.

237
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,759
- Hi, Tom.
- <i>Hi.</i>

238
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,134
Marge, Tom's saying good-bye.

239
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,264
Oh, I'll come down.

240
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,176
So, uh, did you speak to my father?

241
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,475
Oh, you were right...
about the telephones.

242
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,481
- <i>I told you.</i>
- There are no lines.

243
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,313
- There's some problem.
- <i>That's Italy.</i>

244
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,150
Tom. You're off?
What are your plans?

245
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,658
Oh, back, I suppose,
as slow as I can. Oh!

246
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,396
This bag!

247
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,995
Hey. You like jazz.

248
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,764
I love jazz.

249
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,241
This is the best.

250
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,402
Baker, Rollins.

251
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,675
Marge says she likes jazz,
but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz.

252
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,716
- I never said that!
- <i>Bird.</i>

253
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,047
That's jazz.

254
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,417
Bird? Ask me the name of my sailboat.

255
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,456
I don't know.
What's the name of your sailboat?

256
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,718
Look! Look! <i>Bird</i>!

257
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,522
<i>Which is ridiculous.
Boats are female.</i>

258
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,962
Everyone knows you can't
call a boat after a man.

259
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,195
- He's not a man. He's a god.
- Okay, we're going to Naples.

260
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,862
<i>There's a club--
It's not a club, it's a cellar.</i>

261
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,873
- It's vile.
- <i>Yes, it's vile. You don't have to come.</i>

262
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,569
It's great. It's-- It's great.
You're gonna love it.

263
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,907
How are you?

264
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,945
Oh!

265
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,780
That'd be cool. Bring him up.

266
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,018
Tom Ripley!

267
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,529
Come on!
Get on up here!

268
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,369
Yeah!

269
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,564
I'll tell you when to join the chorus.

270
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,574
Come on.

271
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,983
Okay. Together!

272
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:10,351
<i>I bumped into an old friend
from Princeton,</i>

273
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,953
<i>a fellow called Tom Ripley.</i>

274
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,762
<i>He says he's going to haunt me
until I agree...</i>

275
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:21,204
<i>to go back to New York...</i>

276
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,707
with him.

277
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,774
Afternoon.

278
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,817
What time is it?

279
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,818
- Oh, God.
- <i>"Go back to New York with him."</i>

280
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,952
- Here--
- You always type your letters?

281
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:44,317
- That should be two T's.
- I can't write, and I can't spell.

282
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,297
It's the privilege
of a first-class education.

283
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,424
Your room's upstairs at the back.

284
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,163
I think Ermalinda made up the bed.
Ermalinda!

285
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,775
- This is so good of you.
- Don't say it again.

286
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,809
Now that you're a double agent
and we're going to string my dad along,

287
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,647
what if we were to buy a car
with your expense money?

288
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,983
- Okay.
- Great.

289
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,182
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

290
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,555
Marge, Marge, what do you think?

291
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,787
Little <i>Ciquencento</i>
with my dad's money?

292
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,728
Oh, please, Dickie.
You can't even drive a car.

293
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,131
- <i>You can't even drive.</i>
- <i>What we need urgently is an icebox.</i>

294
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,931
What do you think? Agree with me,
and I'll be your friend for life.

295
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,633
- I absolutely agree with Marge.
- Hmm.

296
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,143
Icebox. Icebox.

297
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,550
<i>So, what,
is he gonna move in with you?</i>

298
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,290
It'll just be for a little while.
He can be-- He makes me laugh.

299
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,891
- <i>Okay, darling.</i>
- <i>Promise you'd say?</i>

300
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,801
- No, I like him.
- Marge, you like everybody.

301
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,601
<i>Don't like you.</i>

302
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,165
<i>Then I'll go to your place
and you can move in with Tom.</i>

303
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,486
I like him.

304
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:20,217
Marge, you like everybody.

305
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:27,396
No, I like him.

306
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:32,334
Marge, you like everybody.

307
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:35,930
<i>Now you'll find out why Miss Sherwood
always shows up for breakfast.</i>

308
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,601
It's not love.
It's my coffee machine.

309
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:41,406
<i>Ever since Ermalinda showed him
how to make his own espresso,</i>

310
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,743
<i>he feels like quite the grownup.</i>

311
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:46,578
- I bought the coffee machine.
- <i>Oh, darling, is that for me?</i>

312
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,983
This is for Tom,
because he didn't complain.

313
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,886
<i>That ring is superb.</i>

314
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:54,424
Oh, Tom, I love you.
See?

315
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:59,520
Ooh! I had to promise, capital "P,"
never to take it off.

316
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:02,930
- Otherwise, I'd give it to you.
- Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.

317
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,560
I had to bargain for it
for about two weeks.

318
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,070
I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge.

319
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,074
Oh, it was.

320
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,737
I have to get a birthday present for Frances,
so perhaps you could help me.

321
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:17,645
- Who's Frances?
- My fiancée.

322
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,548
Engaged?
You're a dark horse, Ripley.

323
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:22,552
- <i>Who is she?</i>
- Your parents met her.

324
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,522
Oh, God.
Oh, I can just imagine.

325
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,786
"If only Dickie would settle down.

326
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,918
Doesn't every parent
deserve a grandchild?"

327
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,828
<i>Oh, God. Never. Never.</i>

328
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:38,460
I swear on your ring, Marge,
I'm never going back.

329
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,061
- Say when to pull.
- Pull now. Pull.

330
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,972
It's not pulling.
I'm doing it wrong.

331
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,143
- Better now, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

332
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,147
We'll make a sailor of you yet.

333
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,581
You're doing really well.

334
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:56,882
- All right. Bar's open.
- Yes, please.

335
00:25:56,954 --> 00:26:00,082
- Hey, can we sail to Venice?
- Sure. I love Venice.

336
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,855
"See Venice and die."
Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?

337
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,023
- <i>Is it Rome?</i>
- I have to see Venice.

338
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,933
You do something and die, don't you?
Okay. Venice is on the list.

339
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,563
And Rome.

340
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,664
Do you ski?

341
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:21,673
Ah, no, no. Don't tell me.

342
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,011
You're a lost cause.
That's the next thing to deal with.

343
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:27,710
<i>Christmas, we're planning
a skiing trip to Cortina.</i>

344
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:31,186
- Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge.
- <i>Yes?</i>

345
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,951
<i>Unbelievable. Tom can't ski either.</i>

346
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,188
- We'll have to teach him that too.
- Thank you.

347
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,494
<i>Such low class, Marge.
Does this guy know anything?</i>

348
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:44,830
Good thing we're not
getting married soon.

349
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,632
We'd have to invite Tom
on our honeymoon.

350
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:53,843
<i>Oh, I hated New York.
That whole Park Avenue crowd.</i>

351
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,902
<i>So I fled to Paris
to work on my book.</i>

352
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,074
And I was always going
to this cafe in Monmartre...

353
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,084
with Jean-Jaques.

354
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,713
And Dickie would play
"My Funny Valentine."

355
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:10,125
<i>It was only later that I found out
he only knows about six songs.</i>

356
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:12,526
Anyway, I looked forward
to seeing him, I suppose.

357
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,620
Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!

358
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:46,356
<i>You're not at my place by 7:00,
Tom and I are running off together.</i>

359
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,228
- Okay, fine.
- <i>Oh, Dickie!</i>

360
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:02,068
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

361
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:06,412
<i>Silvana, Silvana</i>

362
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,418
<i>You make me smile</i>

363
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,614
I need to talk to you.

364
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:20,892
- You're breaking my ribs!
- What?

365
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,266
You're breaking my ribs!

366
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:30,268
<i>But don't</i>

367
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,970
<i>Change a hair for me</i>

368
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,806
<i>Not if you care</i>

369
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,181
<i>For me</i>

370
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:48,051
<i>Stay, little Valentine</i>

371
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,863
<i>Stay</i>

372
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,236
<i>Each day</i>

373
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:06,675
<i>Is Valentine's Day</i>

374
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,939
Ohh!

375
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:16,976
I could fuck this icebox,
I love it so much.

376
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:22,283
So, what did you actually do in New York?

377
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,124
Played piano in a few places.
I told you.

378
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,256
Well, that's one job.
You told me a lot of jobs.

379
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,823
Few places. That's a few jobs.

380
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,960
The mysterious Mr. Ripley.

381
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,904
Marge and I spend hours speculating.

382
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:39,238
Anyway, I don't even want
to think about New York.

383
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,835
Are you ready?

384
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:46,110
- <i>Cold beer. Thank you, Dad.</i>
- Okay.

385
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,276
Copy out from here.

386
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,219
- You bring this with you to Europe?
- You gonna write something?

387
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,522
<i>I love the fact that you brought
Shakespeare with you but no clothes.</i>

388
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,995
Ermalinda says you wash out
the same shirt every night. Is that true?

389
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,998
No. I have more than one shirt.

390
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,261
She can do that for you.

391
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,963
Anyway, just wear some of my stuff.

392
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,472
<i>Wear anything you want.
Most of it's ancient.</i>

393
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,769
Now your signature.

394
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,606
Not Dickie. Your signature.

395
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,554
Without the glasses,
you're not even ugly.

396
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:37,958
I don't need them because I never read.

397
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,833
- How do I look?
- Like Clark Kent.

398
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,673
- Now Superman.
- Superman.

399
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,751
- Okay.
- I know.

400
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:59,654
<i>It's like a kid's. See this,
the "S" and the "T"? Fine, vulnerable.</i>

401
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,750
That's pain.
That's secret pain.

402
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,728
Well, that must be a very deep secret,
'cause I don't know about it.

403
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:09,095
Hmm. There's nothing more naked
than your handwriting.

404
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,896
See how nothing's
quite touching the line?

405
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:15,461
- That's vanity.
- Well, we certainly know that's true.

406
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,137
Do you have any brothers?

407
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,150
No.

408
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,345
<i>No brothers, no sisters.</i>

409
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,057
Me neither.

410
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,286
Nor does Marge.

411
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,658
All only children.

412
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,797
What does that mean?

413
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:53,476
Means we've never shared a bath.

414
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,383
And I'm cold. Can I get in?

415
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,285
No.

416
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:14,225
I didn't mean with you in it.

417
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:21,664
<i>Okay.</i>

418
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:25,368
Get in. I'm like a prune anyway.

419
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,156
It is me. It's an old picture.

420
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:53,260
Every time! "Is it you?
It doesn't look like you."

421
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,202
God!

422
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:58,070
Letters-- Greenleaf and for Ripley.

423
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,077
Ooh. Fran. "I miss you.
When are you coming home?

424
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,705
Stop telling me what
an incredible time you're having.

425
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,874
- How much you love Dickie.
- Whoo!

426
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,078
And Marge and Mongibello."

427
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,144
And this one, I think,
is from your father.

428
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:19,987
- Let me see it. What does he say?
- He's getting impatient.

429
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:24,501
He wants me to reassure him that
you're going to be home by Thanksgiving.

430
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:27,401
You've got to get a new jacket.
Really.

431
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,666
<i>You must be sick
of wearing the same clothes.</i>

432
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,709
I can't. I can't keep spending
your father's money.

433
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,711
I love how responsible you are.

434
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:38,907
<i>My dad should make you
chief accountant or something.</i>

435
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,952
<i>Or when I take over,
which is never, I will.</i>

436
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:45,716
Okay. When you take over,
which is never, I'll accept.

437
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,950
Let me buy you a jacket.
When we get to Rome, there's a great place--

438
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:51,654
- Battistoni.
- Battistoni.

439
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,629
<i>Roma, we're taking Tom to Roma</i>

440
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:02,103
<i>We're going to a-Roma</i>

441
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,678
<i>Buon giorno.</i> Nice sweater.

442
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,809
Where do we get a <i>carrozza</i>
for the Forum?

443
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,115
- Can we just hire any of them?
- Relax.

444
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:19,849
Relax!

445
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,722
It's just there's so much to do
in a single day.

446
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:26,752
The most important question is where to eat.
I hope Freddie made a reservation.

447
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,764
Freddie?

448
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:32,131
Freddie. Freddie Miles.

449
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:34,534
Freddie's organizing
the Cortina skiing trip.

450
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,334
Oh.

451
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,967
Oh, here he is.

452
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,608
- Frederico!
- <i>Come stai?</i>

453
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:53,614
Oh, God, don't you want to fuck
every woman you see just once?

454
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,888
- Only once?
- Absolutely. Once. <i>Ciao.</i>

455
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,895
- Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles.
- Tom.

456
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:04,094
I mean, hey, if I'm late,
think what her husband's saying.

457
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,830
- You look gorgeous.
- As always.

458
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,906
So, <i>mangiare.</i>

459
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,306
<i>Si.</i> I got us a table
outside at Fabrizio's. Tommy.

460
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,344
<i>Outstanding. I tell you,</i>

461
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:17,209
- I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi.
- I know. I was there.

462
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,891
<i>Look, Tom, we got to go to a club
and meet some friends of Freddie's.</i>

463
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:39,333
The best thing is, if you want
to be a tourist, grab a cab now,

464
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,099
<i>and I'll meet you
at the railway station.</i>

465
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,106
What club?

466
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,268
Freddie's arranged it
with some of the skiing crowd.

467
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,012
Come if you want, but I thought
you wanted to go sightseeing.

468
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:56,075
I do, and then maybe get the jacket
and what have you.

469
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:58,417
Dick! You gotta hear this.

470
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,524
Listen, just take one of mine
when we get back.

471
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,221
Don't worry about it.

472
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:09,031
Come on!

473
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:21,644
<i>Ciao.</i> Have fun, okay?

474
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:37,760
You said to make sure you didn't miss
the train. Leaves at 8:00.

475
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,889
Have a good time.

476
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,694
See ya, Tommy.

477
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:33,109
<i>If I meant anything to her</i>

478
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:38,288
<i>I'd be brave,
and here's the song I'd bring to her</i>

479
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:41,151
<i>I'd sing to her</i>

480
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:45,353
<i>May I be the only one</i>

481
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:47,896
<i>To say I</i>

482
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:52,264
<i>Really fell in love the day I</i>

483
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:55,668
<i>First set eyes on you</i>

484
00:37:58,074 --> 00:38:01,475
- <i>May I</i>
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

485
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh. I was just amusing myself.

486
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:09,849
- Sorry.
- I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

487
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:14,515
- <i>Do you have my shoes on too?</i>
- You said I could pick out a jacket--

488
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,528
Did you get undressed
in your own room?

489
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:24,662
Thought you missed the train.

490
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:27,328
<i>Freddie drove me back in his car.</i>

491
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:30,395
- Is Freddie here?
- He's downstairs.

492
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:33,636
I was just fooling around.

493
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,703
Don't say anything.
I was just fooling around.

494
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:41,349
Sorry.

495
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,753
<i>God. A corduroy jacket in Italy.</i>

496
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:47,756
- <i>Good morning, Tom.</i>
- Morning.

497
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:50,554
Come join us.

498
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:56,455
<i>Hey. I want this job of yours, Tommy.</i>

499
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:59,467
I was just saying,
you live in Italy,

500
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:03,096
you stay at Dickie's house,
you eat Dickie's food,

501
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:08,041
<i>you wear his clothes,
and his father picks up the tab.</i>

502
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,569
<i>If you get bored,</i>

503
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:15,139
you let me know,
'cause I'll do it.

504
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:18,085
- <i>I'll do it.</i>
- <i>To the mainland!</i>

505
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,356
You really should go in.
It's marvellous.

506
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:28,522
I'm fine.

507
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:40,099
Are you okay?

508
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:43,270
Sure.

509
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:50,147
The thing with Dickie--

510
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:55,247
It's like the sun shines on you,
and it's glorious.

511
00:39:56,726 --> 00:40:00,287
And then he forgets you
and it's very, very cold.

512
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,297
So I'm learning.

513
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:05,857
When you have his attention, you feel
you're the only person in the world.

514
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:08,665
That's why everybody loves him.

515
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:12,469
<i>It's always the same.
Whenever someone new comes into his life--</i>

516
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:15,102
Freddie, Fausto,
Peter Smith-Kingsley.

517
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,510
He's wonderful.
Have you met him?

518
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,450
Especially you.

519
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,753
And that's just the boys.

520
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:40,198
Come get him!
Come get him!

521
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:42,203
Tell me, why is it
that when men play,

522
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:44,831
they always play
at killing each other?

523
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:48,035
<i>He's drowning me!
He's drowning me!</i>

524
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:53,880
- I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way.
- What about Cortina?

525
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:59,219
Didn't--
Didn't-Didn't Dick say?

526
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:03,858
<i>He spoke to Freddie,
and-and apparently...</i>

527
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,860
it's not going to work out.

528
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,064
<i>It's because everyone else can ski,</i>

529
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,396
<i>and it affects where you stay, and--</i>

530
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,333
Come on, Freddie.

531
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:25,005
At least stick around
for the Festival of the Madonna.

532
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:27,675
- <i>The whole town comes out--</i>
- <i>I don't think so.</i>

533
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,414
<i>I have my own, uh, Madonna back in Rome.
Why don't you come back with me?</i>

534
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:35,013
A lot of ladies. Ooh.

535
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:42,858
- Oh, God.
- You want to take over?

536
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,866
Yeah, sure.

537
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,869
Just point her at Capri.
Avoid the rocks.

538
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:50,405
Where are you going?

539
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,464
Marge maintenance.

540
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:54,476
Aye-aye.

541
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:17,565
Don't.

542
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,239
Dickie--

543
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,084
<i>Tommy. How's the peeping?</i>

544
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:44,420
Tommy, how's the peeping?

545
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:48,564
<i>Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.</i>

546
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,566
Is someone getting an ambulance?

547
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:50,818
Is someone getting an ambulance?

548
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:22,315
What's the fight about?
That's her fiancé, isn't it?

549
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:27,253
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?
- Are they blaming him?

550
00:45:27,322 --> 00:45:30,985
How can it take an hour
to find an ambulance?

551
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,584
She was already dead, darling,
wasn't she? So I suppose--

552
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:38,156
I don't know why people say
this country is civilized.

553
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:41,361
- Dickie!
- It isn't. It's fucking primitive.

554
00:45:43,004 --> 00:45:45,404
I'll go see what's the matter.

555
00:45:45,473 --> 00:45:47,407
I'll go.

556
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:05,960
<i>I know why you're upset.</i>

557
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,190
I know about Silvana, Dickie.

558
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:16,029
I know about you and Silvana.

559
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,595
What about us?

560
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:25,304
You don't have to clean up!
Really!

561
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:35,751
- Like what?
- Forget it.

562
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:40,326
She was pregnant.
Did you know that?

563
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:47,959
Silvana was pregnant.

564
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,864
<i>Do you know what that means
in a place like this?</i>

565
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,875
I'm prepared to take the blame.

566
00:46:54,943 --> 00:46:58,845
- What are you talking about?
- You've been so good to me.

567
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:03,646
You're the brother I never had.
I'm the brother you never had.

568
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:06,448
<i>I would do anything for you, Dickie.</i>

569
00:47:08,757 --> 00:47:10,850
She came to me for help.

570
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:13,052
She needed money.

571
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:20,501
I didn't help her.
I didn't help her.

572
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:24,902
<i>Now she's drowned herself,
and it's my fault.</i>

573
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:34,147
I'm not going to say anything--

574
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:37,343
<i>to Marge, to the police
or anybody.</i>

575
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:40,445
It's a secret between us, Dickie.

576
00:47:42,624 --> 00:47:44,558
And I'll keep it.

577
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:48,652
<i>"Dear Tom.
In view of the fact Dickie shows...</i>

578
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:53,531
<i>no more signs of coming home than
before you went--"</i> blah, blah, blah--

579
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:56,365
Um--

580
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:59,066
"I hope that the trip
has afforded you some pleasure...

581
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,337
despite the failure
of its main objective.

582
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,904
You no longer should consider yourself
obligated to us in any way."

583
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:08,972
Can't blame him.

584
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,143
<i>You could hardly expect this
to go on forever, Tom.</i>

585
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:13,710
Well, you can write again.

586
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:16,689
- <i>Especially now we're brothers.</i>
- I can't.

587
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:18,885
How can I, in all decency.

588
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,690
<i>You said it yourself.
It's my dad's money you're spending.</i>

589
00:48:21,763 --> 00:48:25,893
We've had a great run though,
haven't we?

590
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:29,903
Well, we'll still go to Venice.
We could stick to that plan.

591
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:32,030
I don't think so, Tom.

592
00:48:32,106 --> 00:48:34,700
<i>You can't pay your own way,
can you?</i>

593
00:48:34,776 --> 00:48:39,179
<i>It's time we all moved on.</i>

594
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:43,479
I'm sick of Mongi.
Especially now, with everything--

595
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:45,519
I really want to move to the north.

596
00:48:45,587 --> 00:48:48,112
I need to check out San Remo next week.

597
00:48:48,189 --> 00:48:50,214
<i>Find somewhere new to keep the boat.</i>

598
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:53,692
It would be great, though,
if you came with me to San Remo.

599
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:57,253
There's a great jazz festival.
We could say good-bye in style.

600
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:59,892
What do you think?

601
00:48:59,968 --> 00:49:02,732
Our last trip!

602
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:10,243
Sure.

603
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,830
Why do you do
that thing with your neck?

604
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:08,835
What thing?

605
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:14,406
On trains, you always do that thing.

606
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:21,313
Spooky.

607
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:25,216
Spook-- k-k-- k-k-- k-k--

608
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,224
Spooky.

609
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,214
Oh!

610
00:50:54,282 --> 00:50:58,048
Didn't I tell you San Remo was crazy?

611
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:00,917
This is more like it!
Come on!

612
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:13,289
<i>Grazie.</i>

613
00:51:13,368 --> 00:51:16,531
To Mongibello and the
happiest days of my life.

614
00:51:16,604 --> 00:51:19,198
To Mongi.
You're cheerful tonight.

615
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:21,707
I'm suddenly quite happy
to be going back.

616
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:24,540
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom?

617
00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:27,308
I don't think I did, did I?

618
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:30,545
- Why are you asking all of a sudden?
- No reason.

619
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:34,179
Because you're leaving, I guess.
I don't think you were there.

620
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:38,451
- Why?
- I mean it as a compliment.

621
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:40,460
You've got such great taste.

622
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:44,692
Most of the thugs at Princeton
had tasted everything and had no taste.

623
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:49,794
I used to say,
"the cream of America: rich and thick."

624
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:51,964
Freddie's the perfect example.

625
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,634
Then I'll take it as a compliment.

626
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:56,677
I knew it! I knew it.

627
00:51:56,744 --> 00:51:59,611
Marge and I had a bet.

628
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,855
Do you even like jazz,

629
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:12,193
or was that for my benefit?

630
00:52:12,326 --> 00:52:14,988
- I've gotten to like it.
- Oh, yes!

631
00:52:16,664 --> 00:52:19,565
<i>I've gotten to like everything
about the way you live.</i>

632
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:21,863
It's one big love affair.

633
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:26,131
If you knew my life
back home in New York--

634
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:28,300
I'm thinkin' of givin' up the sax.

635
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,502
What do you think about the drums?

636
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:33,809
- What?
- So cool.

637
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:36,782
I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow,
take a look around.

638
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:40,411
This is how I found
my place in Mongi.

639
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:43,513
Took a boat out...

640
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:45,582
around the bay,

641
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:48,219
first thing I liked,

642
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:50,229
I got it.

643
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,865
- <i>Whoa!</i>
- <i>Come on, Dickie. Don't go crazy.</i>

644
00:52:55,936 --> 00:52:58,427
- Dickie. Slow down!
- Hold on.

645
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:00,496
Wait a minute!
It's gonna tip! Oh, God!

646
00:53:00,574 --> 00:53:04,101
Stop it! Somebody!
Somebody! Stop it!

647
00:53:07,648 --> 00:53:09,809
Oh, I love it here!

648
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:12,408
I love it here!
I'm gonna move here!

649
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:15,080
Beautiful.

650
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:22,587
I want to tell you my plan.

651
00:53:22,663 --> 00:53:25,564
- <i>So tell me.</i>
- Well, I thought...

652
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:28,534
I'd come back in the new year
under my own steam.

653
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:31,765
- Really? To Italy?
- Of course.

654
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,331
And I figured,
just for argument's sake,

655
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,434
say I got a place.

656
00:53:37,511 --> 00:53:39,979
Or say we split the rent on a house,

657
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:42,277
I could get a job, or,
better still,

658
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:44,214
if I got a place in Rome,
and then when we're there,

659
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:47,083
we could be there, and when we're here,
we could be here.

660
00:53:47,154 --> 00:53:51,716
- I don't think so.
- Particularly with the Marge problem.

661
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,851
You just blame me.

662
00:53:55,095 --> 00:53:59,532
- Marge and I are getting married.
- How?

663
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,559
- How?
- Yesterday, you were ogling girls.

664
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:05,571
Today you're getting married?
That's absurd.

665
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:11,600
- I love Marge.
- You love me. You're not marrying me.

666
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,443
- Tom, I don't love you.
- No, I don't mean that as a threat.

667
00:54:14,515 --> 00:54:17,609
To be honest,
I'm-I'm a little relieved you're going.

668
00:54:17,685 --> 00:54:20,449
I think we've seen enough
of each other for a while.

669
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:28,193
- What?
- You can be a leech!

670
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:30,196
You know that!

671
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:35,394
<i>And... it's boring.</i>

672
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:40,997
You can be quite boring.

673
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:55,216
The funny thing is,
I'm not pretending...

674
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:57,757
to be somebody else,
and you are.

675
00:54:57,825 --> 00:55:00,988
- Boring.
- <i>I've been absolutely honest with you...</i>

676
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:02,995
about my feelings.

677
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:05,725
- <i>Boring.</i>
- But you-- First of all,

678
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,733
I know there's something.

679
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:10,770
That evening, when we played chess,
for instance, it was obvious.

680
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:14,274
- What evening?
- It's too dangerous for you to take on.

681
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:16,400
<i>Oh, no, no.
We're brothers.</i>

682
00:55:16,477 --> 00:55:21,176
Hey. And then you do this sordid thing
with Marge-- fucking her...

683
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:23,079
<i>on the boat, while we
all have to listen,</i>

684
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,118
<i>which was excruciating.</i>

685
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:28,348
And you follow your cock around like a--
And now you're getting married.

686
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:30,754
<i>No, I'm bewildered.
Forgive me.</i>

687
00:55:30,824 --> 00:55:33,258
You're lying to Marge and then
you're getting married to her.

688
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:37,661
You're knocking up Sylvana, ruining everybody--
You want to play the sax.

689
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:40,131
You want to play the drums. Which is it, Dickie?
What are you actually--

690
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:45,835
Who are you? Huh?
Some third-class mooch? Who are you?

691
00:55:45,906 --> 00:55:47,874
Who are you to say anything to me?

692
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:50,501
Who are you to tell me anything?

693
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:53,671
Actually, I really, really do not want
to be on this boat with you.

694
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:56,181
- <i>I can't move without you moving.</i>
- Shut up. Shut up.

695
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,686
It gives me the creeps.
You give me the creeps.

696
00:55:59,753 --> 00:56:01,721
- You shut up.
- I can't move without "Dickie, Dickie,"

697
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:03,848
like a little girl all the time.

698
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:05,721
Shut up!

699
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:10,024
Oh, God, Dickie.

700
00:56:10,097 --> 00:56:12,861
- God's sake.
- Oh-- Oh God!

701
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:17,493
Okay. Okay.

702
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:19,698
We have to get you-- Okay--

703
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:24,437
I'm gonna kill you!
Kill you!

704
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:29,846
You're dead!

705
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:39,555
Stop! Stop!
Please! Please!

706
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:43,687
Stop it! Stop!

707
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:47,690
- Dickie, let go!
- <i>I'll kill you!</i>

708
00:56:53,407 --> 00:56:57,070
Stop! Stop! Stop!

709
00:56:57,144 --> 00:56:59,942
Stop! Stop! Stop!

710
00:59:03,337 --> 00:59:05,737
Hi. Can I have my key, please?

711
00:59:05,806 --> 00:59:07,774
Of course.

712
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:11,299
You must be very cold.
Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?

713
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:13,312
No. I'm--

714
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:26,542
Hello, Marge.

715
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,248
Tom!

716
01:00:29,322 --> 01:00:31,381
You startled me!

717
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:34,655
- Sorry. How are you?
- <i>You're back!</i>

718
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:37,196
- <i>Your book going well?</i>
- Yes.

719
01:00:37,264 --> 01:00:40,290
I'm on a good streak, thank you.

720
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:43,962
I was just... looking at you.
So quiet.

721
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:46,972
Where's Dickie?

722
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:53,303
I think he's planning
on staying in Rome for a few days.

723
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,146
Rome? Ahh.
Did he say why?

724
01:00:57,217 --> 01:01:00,209
I don't understand Dickie.
Your guess is as good as mine.

725
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,255
What does that mean?

726
01:01:02,322 --> 01:01:06,850
Oh, one day I'm invited skiing,
the next day I'm not.

727
01:01:09,029 --> 01:01:13,295
<i>One day, we're one family,
then the next day he wants to be alone.</i>

728
01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:15,300
<i>You tell me.</i>

729
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:17,928
Is that what he said?
He wants to be alone?

730
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:22,441
He was thinking of you.
He asked me to deliver this.

731
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:25,876
Thank you.

732
01:01:25,946 --> 01:01:28,005
<i>He knows I love this.</i>

733
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:32,843
- But why it couldn't have waited. I--
- <i>Errand number one.</i>

734
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:35,444
deliver Marge's perfume.

735
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:38,082
Errand number two:

736
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:41,355
pack some clothes
and his precious saxophone.

737
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:44,964
How long is he staying for?

738
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:48,467
Search me.
I guess we're abandoned.

739
01:02:14,828 --> 01:02:17,194
Goddamn it!

740
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:20,499
Are you okay?

741
01:02:31,044 --> 01:02:34,377
<i>There was a letter from Dickie
in with my perfume.</i>

742
01:02:36,483 --> 01:02:40,146
You realize it's more
than just a few days.

743
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,213
He's thinking of moving to Rome.

744
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,691
<i>The thing is,</i>

745
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,456
the night before he left, we--

746
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:51,622
we talked about moving together...

747
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,426
<i>somewhere north,</i>
<i>and I suppose I...</i>

748
01:02:58,038 --> 01:03:01,303
put some pressure on him
about getting married.

749
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:05,471
I just--

750
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,778
I just might have scared him off.

751
01:03:15,422 --> 01:03:18,084
There's a side to him...

752
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:21,491
when our heads are on the pillow...

753
01:03:21,561 --> 01:03:24,928
I know no one else sees 
that's so tender.

754
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:30,300
I think I should come with you to Rome
and confront him.

755
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:39,511
He hates being confronted.

756
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,550
I think you're right.

757
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:54,653
<i>Grazie.</i> Checking in.

758
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:05,003
Checking in.

759
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:09,201
- Signor Ripley?
- It's me.

760
01:04:11,377 --> 01:04:14,471
Signor Greenleaf.

761
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:17,038
Of course. Welcome back.

762
01:04:17,116 --> 01:04:19,516
Thank you.

763
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:38,904
<i>Pronto?</i>

764
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:42,339
Yes, I'd like to telephone
the Hotel Goldoni.

765
01:04:42,408 --> 01:04:47,004
- Si, <i>signor.</i>
- <i>I want to speak to Thomas Ripley.</i>

766
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,015
- <i>Ripley?</i> Subito.
- Yes. <i>Grazie.</i>

767
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:02,985
<i>Pronto.</i>

768
01:05:03,062 --> 01:05:04,996
<i>Signor Greenleaf,
Signor Ripley's not there.</i>

769
01:05:05,064 --> 01:05:07,191
- He's not there?
- <i>No, signor.</i>

770
01:05:07,266 --> 01:05:09,996
Well, I would like
to leave a message.

771
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:12,333
- He's not there? I'll leave a message.
- <i>No, signor.</i>

772
01:05:12,405 --> 01:05:14,532
- Got your call.
- <i>Got your call.</i>

773
01:05:14,607 --> 01:05:16,541
- Dinner tonight...
- <i>Dinner tonight...</i>

774
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:18,543
- sounds fine.
- <i>sounds fine.</i>

775
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:22,103
- Ripley. Ripley.
- <i>Ripley.</i>

776
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:25,673
- Dickie Greenleaf.
- <i>Dickie Greenleaf.</i>

777
01:05:25,752 --> 01:05:28,744
- Yes. Greenleaf.
- <i>Greenleaf.</i>

778
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:30,948
At the Grand.

779
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:34,460
<i>And I'd like to have
this wallet embossed.</i>

780
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:36,461
I don't know the word in Italian.

781
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:38,554
Embossed.
Of course, Signor Greenleaf.

782
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:40,599
Thank you.

783
01:05:44,337 --> 01:05:48,034
Dickie! It's--

784
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,044
- Oh, my gosh.
- Meredith.

785
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:55,046
- <i>Ciao!</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i> Come in. Come in.

786
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:57,776
But you're going skiing
with those Yankees, aren't you?

787
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:02,514
- What?
- At Christmas. To Cortina.

788
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,556
- With Freddie Miles.
- How did you know that?

789
01:06:04,624 --> 01:06:08,651
Oh! Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

790
01:06:11,364 --> 01:06:13,355
Is Freddie in Rome?

791
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:15,367
- Now?
- Yeah.

792
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:17,801
Oh, I don't think so.

793
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:22,273
But I-- But I've met him, of course, 
and we've chatted.

794
01:06:22,341 --> 01:06:25,970
And I know about you...

795
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:28,639
and Marge in Mongi.

796
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:31,912
What an unreliable rat you are.

797
01:06:31,984 --> 01:06:34,248
Well, Freddie said you were a rat.

798
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,618
And I thought to myself,

799
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:39,817
"Ah, now I know why he travels under 'R.'"

800
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:42,224
I've left Marge, Meredith.

801
01:06:42,295 --> 01:06:44,525
And Mongi.

802
01:06:44,597 --> 01:06:47,862
- So the rat's here in Rome.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

803
01:06:47,934 --> 01:06:51,062
Oh, don't be sorry, no.
I've never been happier.

804
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:54,436
I-- I feel like
I've been handed a new life.

805
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:58,409
The truth is that if you've had money
your entire life,

806
01:06:58,478 --> 01:07:01,777
either you despise it,
which we do-- agreed?

807
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:04,817
You're only truly comfortable
around other people...

808
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:07,944
who have it and despise it.

809
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,954
I know.

810
01:07:11,457 --> 01:07:14,085
I've never admitted that to anyone.

811
01:07:19,632 --> 01:07:22,897
<i>Because my friend Mr. Greenleaf,
Signor Greenleaf and I,</i>

812
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:24,903
<i>are on a little spending spree.</i>

813
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:28,930
- <i>I see.</i>
- <i>We're behaving very badly.</i>

814
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:33,468
<i>Oh, I love Italian money. So dark.
Doesn't make you feel guilty.</i>

815
01:07:33,546 --> 01:07:35,480
- <i>Gr-r-razie.</i>
- Thank you.

816
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:49,585
I don't want too many large bills.
No one will change them.

817
01:07:49,662 --> 01:07:51,755
<i>Tutto bene,</i> Signor Greenleaf.

818
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,243
- I really like this too.
- I think I'm having that too.

819
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:20,081
Tomorrow.

820
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,388
- <i>Arrivederci.</i>
- <i>Arrivederci.</i> Oops!

821
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:30,535
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

822
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:40,445
I know you're a jazz fiend,
but do you absolutely hate the opera?

823
01:08:43,683 --> 01:08:46,584
I've-- I've...

824
01:08:46,652 --> 01:08:50,281
been trying to give
my tickets away.

825
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:54,793
It's tomorrow. But if you 
were prepared to be dragged--

826
01:08:56,295 --> 01:08:58,490
You could drag me.

827
01:10:46,806 --> 01:10:50,503
Feodor Chaliapin.
It's the whole Russian baritone.

828
01:10:50,576 --> 01:10:53,977
Thank you so much
for inviting me tonight.

829
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:57,880
Can you bear it?
We hear you are a friend of Freddie's.

830
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:01,147
He has "I hate opera"
tattooed on his chest.

831
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,711
There's room for a whole libretto
on Freddie's chest.

832
01:11:05,825 --> 01:11:08,157
I'm sure we've met before.

833
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:11,162
I was sure we'd met before.
Weren't you, Ted?

834
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,255
Dick is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

835
01:11:13,332 --> 01:11:15,892
- I know.
- Yes, I think we have.

836
01:11:15,968 --> 01:11:20,064
One minute you people are children,
and the next you're getting tattooed.

837
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:24,601
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

838
01:11:26,712 --> 01:11:28,646
Cheers.

839
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:35,386
- Excuse me.
- <i>Prego.</i>

840
01:11:35,454 --> 01:11:37,820
Oh! Excuse me.

841
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

842
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:43,561
- Tom!
- Marge!

843
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:46,757
How are you?
What are you doing in Rome?

844
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:50,495
- Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
- No. Um, no.

845
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,630
Um, hello.
Um, I'm Tom Ripley.

846
01:11:53,706 --> 01:11:56,106
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard
all about you from Marge and Dickie.

847
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:59,144
- Ditto.
- No-No glasses.

848
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:02,044
So, where are you hiding him?
He's impossible, isn't he?

849
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:04,241
Is he really not here?

850
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:07,980
Marge, you know Dickie has
"I hate opera" tattooed on his chest.

851
01:12:08,054 --> 01:12:11,080
- I thought you were going to Venice.
- Yes, what happened with that?

852
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:13,091
I heard you were desperate to come.

853
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:15,150
I was rather looking forward
to rowing you around.

854
01:12:15,227 --> 01:12:18,924
I am. I really am.

855
01:12:18,998 --> 01:12:22,229
I've been traveling,
and I just can't seem to get that far north.

856
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,166
Well, you should hurry,
before we sink.

857
01:12:24,236 --> 01:12:27,330
<i>Look, let me give you
the telephone number.</i>

858
01:12:27,406 --> 01:12:30,273
There. Oh, look.
There's Meredith.

859
01:12:30,343 --> 01:12:33,608
<i>Meredith. What's her name, Marge?
The textile people.</i>

860
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,171
Um, come on. Some of us
spent Christmas at her house.

861
01:12:37,249 --> 01:12:40,980
I don't know her.

862
01:12:41,053 --> 01:12:44,853
He hasn't called.
He's hardly written.

863
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:47,051
Just these cryptic notes, you know?

864
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:49,151
You don't just dump people.

865
01:12:49,228 --> 01:12:52,857
<i>Look, will we see you later,
or are you with people?</i>

866
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:55,924
- Uh, I can't later.
- Well, how about tomorrow?

867
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:57,936
<i>Yes, uh, maybe in the morning?</i>

868
01:12:58,004 --> 01:13:01,667
Do you know Cafe Dinelli
at the Piazza di Spagna?

869
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:05,233
- I know the Piazza. What time?
- 10:30?

870
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,541
- We'll be there.
- Okay.

871
01:13:07,613 --> 01:13:09,638
So I'll see you in the morning, Marge?

872
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:12,775
<i>10:30? Very nice to meet you.</i>

873
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:14,911
<i>And you.</i>

874
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:19,655
Come on.

875
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:23,661
Come on.
Let's go back in.

876
01:13:29,568 --> 01:13:32,662
I don't understand 
why Tom's still in Rome.

877
01:13:32,738 --> 01:13:37,004
- Let's go.
- I thought you were enjoying yourself.

878
01:13:37,076 --> 01:13:39,374
Let's take a <i>carrozza</i>
and look at the moon.

879
01:13:39,445 --> 01:13:41,379
Are you crazy?
It's freezing out there.

880
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:44,280
Come on. I need to talk to you.
Just the two of us.

881
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,443
<i>Okay.</i>

882
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:52,713
Don't worry, please.

883
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:55,659
Don't worry.

884
01:13:55,728 --> 01:13:59,824
You're such a pal to understand. I--

885
01:13:59,899 --> 01:14:02,026
It's like Marge is here right now.
I look at you,

886
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:04,194
<i>and I see her face.</i>

887
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:07,034
And I can't-- No matter
what I'm feeling towards you--

888
01:14:07,106 --> 01:14:12,476
No. I absolutely... understand. 
Of c--

889
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:16,037
Otherwise, you'd be fighting me off.

890
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:18,083
Beating you away.

891
01:14:56,756 --> 01:14:59,987
But will you meet me tomorrow?

892
01:15:00,059 --> 01:15:03,290
Just to say good-bye properly,
you know, in the daylight,

893
01:15:03,362 --> 01:15:05,523
so it's not just this.

894
01:15:05,598 --> 01:15:08,362
Of course. Meredith, I'm sorry.
Of course I'll meet you.

895
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:13,667
You should always save pain for daylight.

896
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:17,038
Why don't we have coffee
in the morning at Dinelli's?

897
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:19,270
Uh, by the Spanish Steps.

898
01:15:19,345 --> 01:15:21,176
Exactly. 10:30?

899
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:26,510
- 10:15.
- Okay.

900
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:28,746
Okay.

901
01:16:20,005 --> 01:16:22,337
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- Peter?

902
01:16:22,407 --> 01:16:25,934
<i>Hello. It's Meredith Logue.</i>

903
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:28,673
<i>Of course it is.
Meredith, hello. Sorry.</i>

904
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:31,807
- I was half asleep. How are you?
- How are you?

905
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:34,249
This is Marge Sherwood.
Meredith Logue.

906
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:37,345
How do you do?

907
01:16:37,422 --> 01:16:40,755
<i>Do join us, won't you?
We're just waiting for a friend.</i>

908
01:16:40,825 --> 01:16:43,555
I-- I won't, actually.
I think there's--

909
01:16:43,628 --> 01:16:46,222
- Did we see you at the opera last night?
- Uh--

910
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:49,027
Are you waiting for Dickie?

911
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:53,230
Dickie? Do you-- Do you--
Do you know Dickie?

912
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:56,467
You were at the opera.
Oh, that explains-- Yes, I was there.

913
01:16:56,541 --> 01:17:00,068
I was there with Dickie.

914
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:03,910
I knew it.

915
01:17:03,982 --> 01:17:06,212
<i>I told you.</i>

916
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:12,814
Marge, I don't know you,
so I've got no right to--

917
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:16,088
Dickie loves you.
He's-- Well--

918
01:17:16,161 --> 01:17:19,324
I think you'll find
he's on his way home to you.

919
01:17:19,397 --> 01:17:23,424
Well, how-how-how
would you know that?

920
01:17:24,669 --> 01:17:27,229
He... told me everything.

921
01:17:27,305 --> 01:17:32,242
No, I was supposed to meet him
15 minutes ago, so, uh,

922
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:34,744
I'm gonna go now, I think.

923
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:39,107
God, unless he meant us to meet.

924
01:17:39,184 --> 01:17:41,379
<i>That'd be a little cruel,
wouldn't it?</i>

925
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:43,853
<i>No, no, we're meeting another friend.</i>

926
01:17:43,922 --> 01:17:46,755
- Tom Ripley.
- Do you know Tom Ripley?

927
01:17:46,825 --> 01:17:51,660
No, no. I've heard about him,
of course, but I didn't meet him, no.

928
01:17:51,729 --> 01:17:54,197
Not for me. No, <i>grazie.</i>

929
01:17:59,537 --> 01:18:02,472
Hope I didn't complicate matters.

930
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:07,876
God, nothing, nothing...
untoward happened.

931
01:18:07,946 --> 01:18:12,178
<i>No, there is nothing to prevent you
from welcoming him back,</i>

932
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,184
from marrying him.

933
01:18:18,723 --> 01:18:21,453
Good-bye.
I'm happy to put a face to a name.

934
01:18:21,526 --> 01:18:24,017
Good-bye, Peter.
Please, don't get up.

935
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:47,677
Now I don't know what to think.
Do you think he's coming back?

936
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:52,688
Sorry. Sorry.
Had to renew my papers.

937
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:55,089
Never one stamp when they
can make you line up for three.

938
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,287
- Have you been waiting long?
- Not at all.

939
01:18:57,362 --> 01:19:00,092
- Morning, Tom.
- Hi. Sorry.

940
01:19:00,165 --> 01:19:02,099
<i>You okay? You look like
you've seen a ghost.</i>

941
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:04,863
Dickie was at the opera last night.

942
01:19:04,936 --> 01:19:08,269
I don't believe that. Uh--
Wild horses couldn't drag Dickie--

943
01:19:08,339 --> 01:19:10,637
Well, he was there with someone,
you know,

944
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:13,199
so I suppose she must have dragged him.

945
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:16,111
It's not fair.

946
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:20,345
I think I'm going back to Mongi.
I think Dickie's coming home.

947
01:19:20,418 --> 01:19:23,046
Really? I-- Well, that's just swell.

948
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:25,783
No, you know, you're way ahead of me.
Great.

949
01:19:25,857 --> 01:19:27,825
That was rather moving
when I heard-- I'm sorry.

950
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:30,292
Meredith is the American girl
I saw at the opera last night.

951
01:19:30,361 --> 01:19:34,457
- <i>She's been seeing something of Dickie.</i>
- Oh, my God.

952
01:19:34,532 --> 01:19:37,990
<i>But the point is, Dickie--
and we all know this.</i>

953
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:41,732
Dickie loves Marge.
And he misses her.

954
01:19:41,806 --> 01:19:44,570
I feel guilty.
Marge doesn't understand this,

955
01:19:44,642 --> 01:19:47,509
but whenever Dickie does something,
I feel guilty.

956
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:49,877
As if that makes sense.

957
01:21:13,131 --> 01:21:15,065
<i>Dickie.</i>

958
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:19,134
<i>Dickie, come on. It's me.</i>

959
01:21:21,573 --> 01:21:23,507
It's Freddie. Let me in.

960
01:21:26,544 --> 01:21:28,478
<i>Dickie.</i>

961
01:21:33,752 --> 01:21:36,585
Hello, Freddie. It's Tom.

962
01:21:37,656 --> 01:21:40,591
<i>Um, where's Dickie?</i>

963
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:42,593
How are you?

964
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:45,721
I'm good. Uh, yes, thank you.
He's gone. He went to dinner.

965
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:50,166
- He's at Otello's. You know Otello's?
- No, no, no.

966
01:21:50,235 --> 01:21:53,033
I-I don't think he's at dinner
at 6:30 p.m.

967
01:21:53,104 --> 01:21:56,403
If you said he was still at lunch,
maybe I'd believe you.

968
01:21:56,474 --> 01:22:00,069
You know? Incredible.

969
01:22:00,145 --> 01:22:04,081
I mean, the guy just, you know,
disappeared off the face of the earth.

970
01:22:06,251 --> 01:22:08,185
I guess.

971
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,380
The landlady, as far as I could tell--

972
01:22:12,457 --> 01:22:16,257
<i>The landlady said
he was here right now.</i>

973
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:18,557
Search the place.

974
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:22,031
I-I just don't-- I don't know why
you'd imagine that Dickie would hide from you.

975
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,034
Because he's been hiding from me.

976
01:22:26,204 --> 01:22:30,038
- <i>What happened at Christmas?</i>
- What about Christmas?

977
01:22:30,108 --> 01:22:33,236
<i>He was supposed to come skiing.
I didn't get a cable...</i>

978
01:22:33,311 --> 01:22:35,541
or a call or a little note or a--

979
01:22:35,613 --> 01:22:40,141
<i>Frankly, a fart.</i>

980
01:22:40,218 --> 01:22:42,482
Well, he's been very involved
with his music.

981
01:22:42,554 --> 01:22:46,752
Um, I think his theory... is...

982
01:22:46,825 --> 01:22:51,421
that you have to go into a cocoon,
uh, before you can be a butterfly.

983
01:22:51,496 --> 01:22:54,056
Which is horseshit.

984
01:22:54,132 --> 01:22:57,590
You hear him play this thing?
Well, he can't.

985
01:23:00,472 --> 01:23:02,565
How did you find him?

986
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,632
<i>It's such an out-of-the-way apartment.
Can I fix you a drink?</i>

987
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:08,679
No, thanks.
At the American Express.

988
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:14,551
Some kid.

989
01:23:20,058 --> 01:23:22,993
Are you living here?

990
01:23:23,061 --> 01:23:26,155
No, no. I'm staying here
for a few days.

991
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:31,495
But--

992
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:35,266
It's a new piano.
Probably shouldn't--

993
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:42,405
Probably shouldn't--

994
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:49,116
Did this place come furnished?

995
01:23:49,187 --> 01:23:52,384
<i>It doesn't look like Dickie's, uh--</i>

996
01:23:52,457 --> 01:23:55,551
It's really horrible, isn't it?

997
01:23:57,128 --> 01:24:00,620
<i>It's so, uh, bourgeois.</i>

998
01:24:10,141 --> 01:24:12,336
Oh, that's a, uh--
You should-- Watch that.

999
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:15,538
Excuse-- Excuse me.

1000
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:17,547
Excuse me.

1001
01:24:20,552 --> 01:24:25,216
In fact, the only thing that looks
like Dickie... is you.

1002
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,315
- Hardly.
- Hmm.

1003
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,990
Have you done something to your hair?

1004
01:24:32,063 --> 01:24:34,088
Is there something
you'd like to say, Freddie?

1005
01:24:34,165 --> 01:24:36,565
- What?
- You have something you'd like to say?

1006
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:39,000
I think I'm saying it.

1007
01:24:40,438 --> 01:24:43,601
<i>Something's going on.</i>

1008
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:46,508
Either he's converted to Christianity,

1009
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:49,646
or there's something else.

1010
01:24:51,082 --> 01:24:53,209
Well, I would suggest you
ask Dickie that yourself.

1011
01:24:53,284 --> 01:24:56,185
Otello's is on della Croce
just off the Corso.

1012
01:24:56,254 --> 01:24:59,746
<i>Is it on della Croce
just off the Corso?</i>

1013
01:25:01,826 --> 01:25:06,058
<i>Sure. You're a quick study,
aren't you?</i>

1014
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,064
Last time you didn't know
you ass from your elbow.

1015
01:25:08,132 --> 01:25:10,566
Now you're giving me directions.

1016
01:25:10,635 --> 01:25:14,401
<i>That's not fair. You probably
do know your ass from your elbow.</i>

1017
01:25:17,308 --> 01:25:19,242
I'll see you.

1018
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:33,983
<i>No Dickie Greenleaf. Thomas Ripley.</i>

1019
01:25:34,058 --> 01:25:37,459
<i>Si.</i>

1020
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:44,658
<i>Ciao,</i> Dickie.

1021
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,608
Dickie doesn't play the piano.

1022
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:55,078
<i>Tommy.</i>

1023
01:25:55,146 --> 01:25:57,080
<i>Tommy!</i>

1024
01:26:37,622 --> 01:26:40,420
Oh! You're making me laugh.

1025
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:44,291
No. You're just so drunk.
Oh. You're just--

1026
01:26:44,362 --> 01:26:47,695
What can you do, eh?
You should see my other friends.

1027
01:26:47,765 --> 01:26:50,165
<i>What can you do?</i>

1028
01:26:50,234 --> 01:26:53,465
Yes. Such a pig.

1029
01:26:56,975 --> 01:27:02,242
Hey, if I'm drunk,
think what her husband's saying.

1030
01:27:49,693 --> 01:27:52,059
- <i>La polizia.</i>
- Dickie Greenleaf?

1031
01:27:52,129 --> 01:27:55,155
- Yes.
- Inspector Roverini.

1032
01:27:55,232 --> 01:27:57,257
- Can we come in?
- Please.

1033
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:07,307
It's a terrible shock, huh?

1034
01:28:07,378 --> 01:28:11,075
W-What time did Signor Miles
leave yesterday?

1035
01:28:11,148 --> 01:28:15,175
Oh, um, I can't be certain exactly. I--

1036
01:28:15,252 --> 01:28:17,186
8:00, 9:00.

1037
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:24,460
We'd both taken on, uh,
far too many drinks.

1038
01:28:24,528 --> 01:28:29,090
But it was dark. It was certainly dark
when I-- when I walked him to his car.

1039
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:32,135
So he drove away,
and, uh, you did what?

1040
01:28:32,202 --> 01:28:35,296
I went to bed.

1041
01:28:35,372 --> 01:28:40,036
Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble
after a couple of drinks.

1042
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:43,477
I've been suffering all--

1043
01:28:43,547 --> 01:28:45,606
Who found him?

1044
01:28:45,682 --> 01:28:48,276
You understand, I must ask you...

1045
01:28:48,352 --> 01:28:50,912
to stay in Rome, Signor Greenleaf.

1046
01:28:50,988 --> 01:28:54,321
Yes, if it's gonna help, certainly.

1047
01:28:54,391 --> 01:28:58,191
<i>So, the doctor,
he has to make the, um--</i>

1048
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:04,896
- Postmortem.
- Yeah, exactly.

1049
01:29:04,968 --> 01:29:07,630
But, you know, his first conclusion...

1050
01:29:07,704 --> 01:29:12,767
was that Signor Miles was killed
not later than 7:00 yesterday evening.

1051
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:16,244
Well, he certainly wasn't dead
when he drove away in his car.

1052
01:29:18,348 --> 01:29:20,282
No.

1053
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:48,100
It's okay.

1054
01:29:48,178 --> 01:29:50,578
- Okay?
- <i>Si, si.</i>

1055
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:04,553
- Did he kill Freddie?
- Marge. When did you get here?

1056
01:30:04,628 --> 01:30:07,256
Tell me the truth.
Did he kill Freddie?

1057
01:30:07,331 --> 01:30:10,858
I'd swear he didn't.
Of course he didn't.

1058
01:30:10,934 --> 01:30:15,166
I tried again.
Waiting here, watching for him.

1059
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:18,834
Instead, it's you.
Whenever I look for Dickie, I find you.

1060
01:30:20,744 --> 01:30:23,736
What happened to your face?

1061
01:30:23,814 --> 01:30:25,748
Dickie-- Dickie did it.

1062
01:30:25,816 --> 01:30:28,046
- Dickie?
- My face. There was an argument.

1063
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:30,814
I-- I said some things
I shouldn't have said and I--

1064
01:30:30,888 --> 01:30:34,517
About you. About the appalling way
he's treating you, all of us.

1065
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:36,889
<i>And the next thing I know,
he's launched himself at me.</i>

1066
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,087
- Are you getting on?
- What?

1067
01:30:39,163 --> 01:30:41,324
Get on. I'll take you to him.

1068
01:31:25,809 --> 01:31:28,039
- Where does he live?
- We passed it a few blocks back.

1069
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:30,545
It's where the police were.
The Palazzo Gioia.

1070
01:31:32,549 --> 01:31:35,518
Look, they don't even know I'm in Rome,
and I'm not gonna incriminate Dickie.

1071
01:31:35,586 --> 01:31:37,611
Well, perhaps I shouldn't go either.

1072
01:31:37,688 --> 01:31:41,317
No. Well, go if you want to, but just
don't talk to the police about my face.

1073
01:31:41,391 --> 01:31:44,758
If they know he hit me and his temper,
then he could've hit Freddie.

1074
01:31:44,828 --> 01:31:46,819
I'll catch up with you later.

1075
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:08,052
Signor Greenleaf!

1076
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:10,713
It's Signor Greenleaf!
<i>Presto, presto!</i>

1077
01:32:16,194 --> 01:32:18,389
Open the door!

1078
01:32:18,463 --> 01:32:20,863
Open up!

1079
01:32:20,932 --> 01:32:23,196
I live here!

1080
01:32:24,369 --> 01:32:26,303
Mr. Greenleaf!

1081
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:29,867
Can we go up? Do you mind?

1082
01:32:29,941 --> 01:32:32,535
Of course.
What happened to your face?

1083
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:36,307
My scooter. I fell off
getting chased by photographers.

1084
01:32:36,381 --> 01:32:40,408
The telephone, the press, I've been--
I'm feeling hounded.

1085
01:32:40,485 --> 01:32:42,612
Do you think you could
not give out my address?

1086
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:47,317
Never. We've had many requests,
and we say no, even to your fiancée.

1087
01:32:47,392 --> 01:32:49,326
I really don't want to see anybody.

1088
01:32:49,394 --> 01:32:52,158
- <i>Even your fiancée?</i>
- Even her.

1089
01:32:55,266 --> 01:32:58,463
- <i>What about Thomas Ripley?</i>
- What about Tom Ripley?

1090
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:02,462
You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo.
Is that right?

1091
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:05,668
Yes, we-- We went to San Remo.
That was months ago.

1092
01:33:05,743 --> 01:33:07,904
November, I thought. Was it?

1093
01:33:07,979 --> 01:33:11,540
- Did you speak to Tom?
- November 7 is my information.

1094
01:33:11,616 --> 01:33:14,346
<i>I don't remember the exact date.</i>

1095
01:33:14,419 --> 01:33:18,856
- When did you last see Signor Ripley?
- A few days ago.

1096
01:33:18,923 --> 01:33:22,518
- <i>Does he stay with you here?</i>
- No.

1097
01:33:22,593 --> 01:33:24,959
<i>No.</i>

1098
01:33:26,331 --> 01:33:29,300
Here is a pattern.
Two days ago,

1099
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:32,359
Freddie Miles is dead, hmm?

1100
01:33:33,604 --> 01:33:36,072
<i>He leaves your apartment,</i>

1101
01:33:37,141 --> 01:33:39,905
and he's murdered.

1102
01:33:39,977 --> 01:33:45,108
Yesterday, a little boat
is found in San Remo full of rocks.

1103
01:33:45,183 --> 01:33:50,052
<i>And the owner tells the police
it was stolen on November 7.</i>

1104
01:33:50,121 --> 01:33:52,612
<i>We look at hotel records...</i>

1105
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:55,488
and we see...

1106
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,757
Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo.

1107
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:02,596
And then our boatman remembers
two Americans taking a boat.

1108
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:05,465
That is not a pattern.
That's a coincidence.

1109
01:34:05,536 --> 01:34:07,504
There must be 50 hotels in San Remo.

1110
01:34:07,572 --> 01:34:10,405
There were probably a hundred people
renting a boat that day.

1111
01:34:10,475 --> 01:34:12,966
Thirty-one people.

1112
01:34:13,044 --> 01:34:15,069
Thirty-one people.

1113
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,114
Thirty-one, yeah.

1114
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:22,945
- <i>Marge Sherwood.</i>
- That is Miss Sherwood now.

1115
01:34:31,696 --> 01:34:33,721
Let her in.

1116
01:34:33,798 --> 01:34:36,460
Let her in.
What's the difference? Let her in.

1117
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:42,339
No! Actually-- Actually, no.

1118
01:34:42,407 --> 01:34:45,308
I would-- I would really appreciate it...

1119
01:34:45,376 --> 01:34:48,243
<i>if you would ask Miss Sherwood
to come back later.</i>

1120
01:34:52,784 --> 01:34:55,651
Thank you.

1121
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:59,315
May I ask you--

1122
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:02,951
Why would you speak to your friend
and not your fiancée?

1123
01:35:03,027 --> 01:35:06,360
Well, I-- I think I just said.

1124
01:35:06,431 --> 01:35:09,764
<i>Um, Mr. Ripley was handling
some business for me.</i>

1125
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:12,462
<i>Nor does Mr. Ripley
want to marry me...</i>

1126
01:35:12,537 --> 01:35:16,564
and ask me every single day
if I'll marry him and when.

1127
01:35:17,742 --> 01:35:19,733
Do you keep a photograph of Signor Ripley?

1128
01:35:19,811 --> 01:35:23,679
I'm not in the habit of carrying
around photographs of my male friends.

1129
01:35:25,316 --> 01:35:27,250
Now I think I've upset you.

1130
01:35:27,318 --> 01:35:30,446
Sorry. My English, perhaps, is coarse.

1131
01:35:30,521 --> 01:35:32,989
It is a little coarse, yes.

1132
01:35:36,494 --> 01:35:38,428
I'm sorry.

1133
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:43,490
<i>But you-- No one has seen
Signor Ripley since San Remo.</i>

1134
01:35:43,568 --> 01:35:45,502
- I have.
- You have, yes.

1135
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:48,300
And so has Miss Sherwood.
Ask her. And, um,

1136
01:35:48,372 --> 01:35:53,503
if I can remember the name
of the hotel he was staying at--

1137
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:56,604
Um, the Goldoni.
Tom was staying at the Goldoni.

1138
01:35:56,681 --> 01:36:00,082
Goldoni. The Goldoni.
Good, good, but--

1139
01:36:00,151 --> 01:36:02,711
Yes, you are right.

1140
01:36:02,787 --> 01:36:05,051
You are right. A coincidence.

1141
01:36:07,124 --> 01:36:10,719
I look forward to our next meeting.

1142
01:36:10,795 --> 01:36:12,786
Hmm? When I will be more careful
with my English.

1143
01:36:12,864 --> 01:36:17,130
<i>Ah. I have a witness
who thinks they saw two men...</i>

1144
01:36:17,201 --> 01:36:19,135
<i>getting into Mr. Miles' car.</i>

1145
01:36:19,203 --> 01:36:23,105
<i>And she wants to identify you
in a</i> confronto.

1146
01:36:23,174 --> 01:36:25,665
Lineup. Tomorrow, then?

1147
01:36:27,178 --> 01:36:29,112
Uh, tomorrow.

1148
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:38,655
- Buon giorno, <i>Miss Sherwood.</i>
- Buon giorno.

1149
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:42,887
<i>He's in, but I really don't think
he wants to meet anybody.</i>

1150
01:37:00,278 --> 01:37:02,212
Dick?

1151
01:37:05,683 --> 01:37:07,844
Dickie?

1152
01:37:09,387 --> 01:37:11,321
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

1153
01:37:20,164 --> 01:37:23,463
I was gonna say that I would count to three,
and if you didn't open the door--

1154
01:37:23,534 --> 01:37:27,800
But I won't count anymore.

1155
01:37:27,872 --> 01:37:29,863
On you.

1156
01:37:31,909 --> 01:37:35,401
I won't count on you anymore.

1157
01:37:38,883 --> 01:37:43,786
Whatever it is you've done
or haven't done,

1158
01:37:43,854 --> 01:37:46,345
you've broken my heart.

1159
01:37:48,593 --> 01:37:51,027
<i>That's one thing
I know you're guilty of.</i>

1160
01:37:58,603 --> 01:38:01,037
And I don't know why.

1161
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:06,942
I don't know why.
I just don't know why.

1162
01:38:16,787 --> 01:38:19,017
<i>My dear Tom,</i>

1163
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:22,617
<i>I'm getting out of this.</i>

1164
01:38:22,693 --> 01:38:26,220
<i>Freddie's death. Silvana.</i>

1165
01:38:26,297 --> 01:38:30,495
<i>I've thought about going to the police,
but I can't do it.</i>

1166
01:38:30,568 --> 01:38:32,934
<i>I can't face it.</i>

1167
01:38:33,004 --> 01:38:34,763
<i>I can't face anything anymore.</i>

1168
01:38:35,838 --> 01:38:38,602
<i>I wish I could give you
the life I took for granted.</i>

1169
01:38:41,678 --> 01:38:44,238
<i>You've always understood
what's at the heart of me, Tom.</i>

1170
01:38:44,313 --> 01:38:47,680
<i>Marge never could.</i>

1171
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:51,151
<i>I suppose that's why
I'm writing this to you,</i>

1172
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:53,848
<i>the brother I never had.</i>

1173
01:38:53,923 --> 01:38:56,653
<i>The only true friend I ever had.</i>

1174
01:39:02,331 --> 01:39:04,265
<i>In all kinds of ways,</i>

1175
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:08,633
<i>you're much more
like the son my father wanted.</i>

1176
01:39:08,705 --> 01:39:11,936
<i>I realize you can change the people,</i>

1177
01:39:12,008 --> 01:39:14,499
<i>change the scenery,</i>

1178
01:39:14,577 --> 01:39:16,772
<i>but you can't change
your own rotten self.</i>

1179
01:39:19,582 --> 01:39:22,312
<i>Now I can't think what to do
or where to go.</i>

1180
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:28,982
<i>I'm haunted by everything I've done
and can't undo.</i>

1181
01:39:30,593 --> 01:39:32,527
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1182
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:37,997
<i>I've made a mess of being
Dickie Greenleaf, haven't I?</i>

1183
01:40:42,365 --> 01:40:45,357
<i>Tom!</i>

1184
01:40:47,537 --> 01:40:50,802
I'll see you over there!

1185
01:40:59,215 --> 01:41:01,513
I'm so sorry to put you
through this, Peter.

1186
01:41:01,584 --> 01:41:05,179
I just can't face going to the police by myself
when my Italian's so rotten.

1187
01:41:05,254 --> 01:41:07,245
Don't be so daft. It's fine.

1188
01:41:07,323 --> 01:41:09,985
I'm delighted you finally
made it to Venice.

1189
01:41:10,059 --> 01:41:12,687
I'm delighted, contrary to rumor,
that you're still in one piece.

1190
01:41:12,762 --> 01:41:14,753
- What rumor?
- Oh, you know.

1191
01:41:14,831 --> 01:41:18,267
That Dickie murdered you
and is traveling under your passport.

1192
01:41:18,334 --> 01:41:20,427
I know. It's ridiculous.

1193
01:41:35,284 --> 01:41:37,218
Welcome to Venice.

1194
01:41:37,286 --> 01:41:40,312
God, this place reeks, doesn't it?
Can you smell it?

1195
01:41:40,389 --> 01:41:44,257
Anyway, I've got to the bottom
of the delay, finally.

1196
01:41:44,327 --> 01:41:47,262
We're waiting for someone from Rome.

1197
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,662
What do you mean?
They've sent for someone from Rome?

1198
01:41:49,732 --> 01:41:52,860
- Well, yes. That's good, isn't it?
- <i>No, I thought...</i>

1199
01:41:52,935 --> 01:41:56,302
that didn't happen in Italy,
that each region is separate.

1200
01:41:56,372 --> 01:41:58,806
I was sure that--
I've read that--

1201
01:41:58,875 --> 01:42:01,742
You've read the papers.
You know what a big deal it's been.

1202
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:04,871
- <i>American tourist murdered.</i>
- Actually, can we not do this now?

1203
01:42:04,947 --> 01:42:09,008
The stench really is--

1204
01:42:26,302 --> 01:42:30,932
He's taken over the case, 'cause
they're annoyed that the previous chap...

1205
01:42:31,007 --> 01:42:33,874
<i>let Dickie disappear
when he was, um,</i>

1206
01:42:33,943 --> 01:42:35,934
<i>the only suspect in Freddie's murder.</i>

1207
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:42,246
In Rome, about three weeks ago.

1208
01:42:42,318 --> 01:42:44,252
I knew that one.

1209
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:48,381
Um--

1210
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:56,329
Are you a homosexual?
Interesting non sequitur.

1211
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:58,424
No.

1212
01:42:58,501 --> 01:43:01,732
- No.
- Oh.

1213
01:43:01,804 --> 01:43:06,707
By the way, um, officially
there are no Italian homosexuals.

1214
01:43:06,776 --> 01:43:09,301
Makes Michelangelo and Leonardo
very inconvenient.

1215
01:43:09,378 --> 01:43:11,073
Eh?

1216
01:43:11,147 --> 01:43:14,344
Tell him... I have a fiancée.

1217
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:16,783
And Dickie has a fiancée.

1218
01:43:16,852 --> 01:43:20,481
And that Freddie Miles
probably had a string of them.

1219
01:43:32,134 --> 01:43:36,036
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

1220
01:43:39,608 --> 01:43:41,838
- What did he say?
- He says "so many fiancées."

1221
01:43:47,016 --> 01:43:49,985
<i>He's asking...
if you killed Freddie Miles...</i>

1222
01:43:50,052 --> 01:43:51,986
<i>and then killed Dickie Greenleaf.</i>

1223
01:43:52,054 --> 01:43:56,013
No! No, I did not kill Freddie Miles
and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.

1224
01:43:56,092 --> 01:43:59,289
<i>Is he accusing me?
Ask him if he's accusing me.</i>

1225
01:43:59,362 --> 01:44:02,126
The way it works here,
it's better to be less volatile.

1226
01:44:02,198 --> 01:44:04,359
<i>But it's absurd!</i>

1227
01:44:19,882 --> 01:44:24,342
They found this
in Dickie's place in Rome.

1228
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:26,980
- You opened this?
- Of course.

1229
01:44:43,305 --> 01:44:46,138
It's a suicide note.

1230
01:44:49,945 --> 01:44:53,813
You asked me all these questions
and you already read this suicide note?

1231
01:45:12,168 --> 01:45:14,261
I don't believe that letter.
Do you?

1232
01:45:14,336 --> 01:45:17,863
Dickie's letter.
Do you believe it?

1233
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,374
I don't know what to believe.

1234
01:45:20,443 --> 01:45:25,148
Can you imagine, though, if he did kill Freddie,
what that must be like?

1235
01:45:25,281 --> 01:45:29,115
Just to wake up every morning.
I mean, how can you?

1236
01:45:29,185 --> 01:45:32,677
Just wake up and be a person?
Drink your coffee.

1237
01:45:32,755 --> 01:45:37,158
Well, whatever you do,
however terrible, however hurtful,

1238
01:45:37,226 --> 01:45:40,525
it all makes sense, doesn't it,
in your head.

1239
01:45:40,596 --> 01:45:43,360
You never meet anybody
who thinks they're a bad person.

1240
01:45:43,432 --> 01:45:47,459
No, I know, but you're still tormented.
You must be. You've killed someone.

1241
01:45:47,537 --> 01:45:50,665
Don't you just take the past
and put it in a room in the basement,

1242
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,731
and lock the door
and never go in there?

1243
01:45:52,808 --> 01:45:56,175
- That's what I do.
- God, yes.

1244
01:45:56,245 --> 01:46:00,875
But, of course, in my case,
it's probably a whole building.

1245
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:03,976
And then you meet someone special,

1246
01:46:04,053 --> 01:46:08,114
and all you want to do
is toss them the key.

1247
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:12,018
Say "Open up. Step inside."

1248
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:16,960
But you can't...

1249
01:46:17,033 --> 01:46:19,797
because it's dark...

1250
01:46:19,869 --> 01:46:22,736
and there are demons.

1251
01:46:23,806 --> 01:46:26,240
And if anybody saw how ugly it is--

1252
01:46:30,947 --> 01:46:33,006
Now that's the music talking.

1253
01:46:35,284 --> 01:46:38,617
It's harder to be bleak if you're playing
"Knees Up, Mother Brown."

1254
01:46:44,327 --> 01:46:47,296
I keep wanting to do that.

1255
01:46:47,363 --> 01:46:51,231
Fling... the door open.

1256
01:46:53,603 --> 01:46:57,369
Just let the light in,
clean everything out.

1257
01:46:59,675 --> 01:47:03,668
If I could take a giant eraser
and rub out everything,

1258
01:47:03,746 --> 01:47:06,681
starting with myself--

1259
01:47:09,252 --> 01:47:12,483
<i>The thing is, Peter, if--</i>

1260
01:47:14,991 --> 01:47:18,654
- <i>Hmm?</i>
- If--

1261
01:47:20,496 --> 01:47:22,430
If--

1262
01:47:29,505 --> 01:47:31,837
No key, huh?

1263
01:48:16,252 --> 01:48:18,243
- Marge.
- Peter.

1264
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:22,658
- So good to see you.
- Hello, Marge.

1265
01:48:22,725 --> 01:48:24,920
Tom.

1266
01:48:24,994 --> 01:48:29,055
- I see you found Peter.
- I think we sort of found each other.

1267
01:48:29,131 --> 01:48:32,828
- Where's Dickie's father?
- He's not coming till the morning.

1268
01:48:32,902 --> 01:48:36,463
Evidently his stomach. I don't think
the food here is agreeing with him.

1269
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:38,473
Oh, I was looking forward
to seeing him.

1270
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:41,271
Dickie hasn't killed himself.
I'm sure of that.

1271
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,904
There's a private detective
on the case now.

1272
01:48:43,979 --> 01:48:46,470
A Mr. MacCarron Dickie's father's employed.

1273
01:48:46,549 --> 01:48:49,916
- That's a terrific idea.
- He's American.

1274
01:48:49,985 --> 01:48:53,318
He's already discovered that Dickie
cashed checks for $1,000...

1275
01:48:53,389 --> 01:48:55,584
the day before he disappeared.

1276
01:48:55,658 --> 01:48:57,592
Signora.

1277
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:01,096
Is that what you do
before you jump into the Tiber?

1278
01:49:01,163 --> 01:49:03,757
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1279
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:09,800
- Is this you?
- No, it's Tom's.

1280
01:49:09,872 --> 01:49:11,806
Splendid, eh?

1281
01:49:11,874 --> 01:49:15,207
Golly. Who's paying for this?

1282
01:49:15,277 --> 01:49:17,245
Peter found it for me.

1283
01:49:17,313 --> 01:49:22,216
I can afford it because it's damp and...
falling down.

1284
01:49:22,284 --> 01:49:25,447
- Tom's transformed it.
- This is spectacular.

1285
01:49:25,521 --> 01:49:27,785
That's why Tom wanted you to stay.

1286
01:49:27,857 --> 01:49:30,451
<i>It's better than trying
to squeeze into my room.</i>

1287
01:49:30,526 --> 01:49:32,619
<i>And I know how you hate hotels.</i>

1288
01:49:32,695 --> 01:49:34,686
A hotel would have been fine.

1289
01:49:38,134 --> 01:49:42,696
We'll have to tell Mr. Greenleaf
how far his dollar stretched.

1290
01:49:46,075 --> 01:49:49,101
What's funny?

1291
01:49:49,178 --> 01:49:52,705
I was just thinking about
when Tom first came to Mongibello.

1292
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:58,208
- And look at you now.
- Look at me what?

1293
01:49:59,488 --> 01:50:01,456
To the manor born.

1294
01:50:15,604 --> 01:50:17,799
<i>Mr. Greenleaf?</i>

1295
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:23,644
Mr. Greenleaf?

1296
01:50:23,712 --> 01:50:27,409
Tom. How are you?
You look well.

1297
01:50:27,483 --> 01:50:30,316
- Thank you, sir. I am well.
- Far cry from New York.

1298
01:50:30,386 --> 01:50:32,877
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>
- Marge.

1299
01:50:32,955 --> 01:50:36,015
Good morning. Unusual weather.

1300
01:50:36,091 --> 01:50:38,958
- Very.
- And you, sir. Any better?

1301
01:50:39,028 --> 01:50:42,122
Pretty good.
Sticking with hot water.

1302
01:50:42,198 --> 01:50:44,530
- Where's Mr. MacCarron?
- San Remo.

1303
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:47,330
<i>The police are amateurs.</i>

1304
01:50:47,403 --> 01:50:51,931
<i>Well, my boy, it's come
to a pretty pass, hasn't it?</i>

1305
01:50:52,007 --> 01:50:55,204
What is the detective
hoping to find in San Remo?

1306
01:50:55,277 --> 01:51:00,112
<i>He's being thorough.
I'm learning about my son, Tom.</i>

1307
01:51:00,182 --> 01:51:03,618
Now he's missing,
I'm learning a great deal about him,

1308
01:51:03,686 --> 01:51:06,780
and I hope that you can fill in
some more blanks for me.

1309
01:51:06,856 --> 01:51:09,916
Marge has been good enough
to do that about Mongibello.

1310
01:51:09,992 --> 01:51:13,792
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously,
I'll do anything to help Dickie.

1311
01:51:13,863 --> 01:51:16,354
<i>Good. This theory,</i>

1312
01:51:16,432 --> 01:51:18,559
<i>the letter he left for you.</i>

1313
01:51:18,634 --> 01:51:21,899
<i>The police think that's
a clear indication...</i>

1314
01:51:21,971 --> 01:51:25,702
he was planning on doing something,
uh, to himself.

1315
01:51:25,774 --> 01:51:28,572
I just don't believe that.

1316
01:51:28,644 --> 01:51:31,169
You don't want to, dear.

1317
01:51:34,383 --> 01:51:36,408
I'd like to talk to Tom alone.

1318
01:51:36,485 --> 01:51:39,283
<i>Perhaps this afternoon.
Would you mind?</i>

1319
01:51:41,724 --> 01:51:45,751
Marge, what a man may say
to his sweetheart...

1320
01:51:45,828 --> 01:51:47,989
and what he'll admit
to another fellow--

1321
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,996
Such as?

1322
01:51:57,706 --> 01:52:00,971
What a waste of lives and opportunities.

1323
01:52:01,043 --> 01:52:04,069
I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
right now to shut up!

1324
01:52:12,388 --> 01:52:15,755
No, Marge doesn't know
the half of it.

1325
01:52:15,824 --> 01:52:19,089
And his passport photo.

1326
01:52:19,161 --> 01:52:22,065
Did you hear?
To scratch out his own face like that?

1327
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:24,325
Can you imagine?

1328
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,665
Frame of mind you'd have to be in?

1329
01:52:27,737 --> 01:52:31,036
"I've thought about going to the police,
but I can't face it.

1330
01:52:31,107 --> 01:52:34,634
I can't face anything anymore."

1331
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:38,043
I feel guilty.
I feel like I pushed him away.

1332
01:52:38,114 --> 01:52:40,173
I feel like I spoke
and he heard you.

1333
01:52:40,249 --> 01:52:43,047
Well,

1334
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:45,713
if we all pushed him away,
what about him pushing us away?

1335
01:52:45,788 --> 01:52:48,382
You've been a great friend to my son.

1336
01:52:48,458 --> 01:52:51,586
Everything is someone else's fault.

1337
01:52:51,661 --> 01:52:54,129
<i>We all want to sow wild oats,</i>

1338
01:52:54,197 --> 01:52:57,530
but somebody's got to--
got to--

1339
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,398
What is the word?

1340
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:03,667
You know, the moment
someone confronts him,

1341
01:53:05,041 --> 01:53:07,566
he lashes out.

1342
01:53:07,643 --> 01:53:10,203
He always has.

1343
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:14,147
You know, people always say
that you can't choose your parents,

1344
01:53:18,888 --> 01:53:21,379
but you can't choose your children.

1345
01:53:22,758 --> 01:53:26,319
<i>Dickie.</i>

1346
01:53:26,395 --> 01:53:29,990
<i>You can be a leech.
You can be quite boring.</i>

1347
01:53:30,066 --> 01:53:32,000
- <i>Stop it!</i>
- <i>It's boring.</i>

1348
01:53:36,105 --> 01:53:38,437
<i>Stop, stop, stop!</i>

1349
01:53:39,942 --> 01:53:41,842
- <i>Stop, stop, stop!</i>
- <i>Tommy, Tommy.</i>

1350
01:53:41,911 --> 01:53:43,845
<i>Like a little girl.</i>

1351
01:53:43,913 --> 01:53:47,007
<i>Like a little girl.</i>

1352
01:53:50,653 --> 01:53:52,621
Coming.

1353
01:53:52,688 --> 01:53:55,054
- Sorry. I was asleep.
- Finally.

1354
01:53:55,124 --> 01:53:57,251
- I must have fallen asleep.
- Did Dickie's dad go?

1355
01:53:57,326 --> 01:53:59,260
You look ghastly, Tom.
Did you have a nightmare?

1356
01:53:59,328 --> 01:54:02,525
- He's having an early night.
- <i>Oh, poor man.</i>

1357
01:54:02,598 --> 01:54:05,089
<i>You know, we were banging
on that door forever.</i>

1358
01:54:08,671 --> 01:54:10,605
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1359
01:54:10,673 --> 01:54:14,268
- I think I've broken a strap.
- Not guilty.

1360
01:54:14,343 --> 01:54:17,312
I'll fix some drinks.

1361
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:20,008
Ah! You walk in Venice.

1362
01:54:21,551 --> 01:54:23,485
Are you okay?

1363
01:54:24,954 --> 01:54:26,819
I'm fine.

1364
01:54:26,889 --> 01:54:31,053
- Did you want me to stick around?
- No, it's okay.

1365
01:54:33,095 --> 01:54:35,290
I could come back.

1366
01:54:50,613 --> 01:54:52,740
Your key.

1367
01:54:56,452 --> 01:54:59,148
<i>Tom?</i>

1368
01:54:59,222 --> 01:55:02,714
Marge, I'm in the bath.
I won't be long.

1369
01:55:02,792 --> 01:55:05,022
<i>Tom, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.</i>

1370
01:55:08,764 --> 01:55:10,698
Coming.

1371
01:55:22,211 --> 01:55:25,510
- I found Dickie's rings.
- What?

1372
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:27,572
You have Dickie's rings.

1373
01:55:32,355 --> 01:55:34,289
I can explain.

1374
01:55:34,357 --> 01:55:37,053
<i>Dickie promised me
he would never take off this ring.</i>

1375
01:55:37,126 --> 01:55:40,186
Let me put some clothes on
and we'll talk about this.

1376
01:55:40,263 --> 01:55:42,697
- I have to tell Mr. Greenleaf.
- Marge, you're being hysterical.

1377
01:55:42,765 --> 01:55:46,223
He promised me, "I swear, I will never
take off this ring until we get--"

1378
01:55:46,302 --> 01:55:48,236
Shut up!

1379
01:55:50,439 --> 01:55:53,897
I'm wet, Marge.
I've lost my towel.

1380
01:55:53,976 --> 01:55:56,968
<i>And I'd really like to put
some clothes on.</i>

1381
01:55:57,046 --> 01:55:59,071
Go and pour us both a drink.

1382
01:56:02,485 --> 01:56:04,419
Pour us a drink.

1383
01:56:37,787 --> 01:56:40,119
Marge?

1384
01:56:40,189 --> 01:56:42,453
Where are you going?

1385
01:56:42,525 --> 01:56:45,983
I wasn't snooping. I just--

1386
01:56:46,062 --> 01:56:48,997
I was looking for a needle
and thread to mend my bra.

1387
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,595
That scent you're wearing.

1388
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:57,901
I bought that for you.

1389
01:56:57,973 --> 01:57:00,533
The thing about Dickie--

1390
01:57:00,609 --> 01:57:02,543
<i>So many things.</i>

1391
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:08,041
That day when he was late
coming back from Rome,

1392
01:57:08,117 --> 01:57:10,051
I tried to tell you this.

1393
01:57:10,119 --> 01:57:13,611
He was with another girl.
I'm not talking about Meredith, either.

1394
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:16,920
Another girl that we met in a bar.

1395
01:57:16,992 --> 01:57:20,052
<i>He couldn't be faithful
for five minutes.</i>

1396
01:57:20,129 --> 01:57:22,154
<i>So when he makes a promise,</i>

1397
01:57:22,231 --> 01:57:24,290
it doesn't mean what it means
when you make a promise...

1398
01:57:24,367 --> 01:57:26,927
or I make a promise.

1399
01:57:27,002 --> 01:57:30,995
He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.

1400
01:57:31,073 --> 01:57:34,270
He lies. He lies.

1401
01:57:34,343 --> 01:57:38,746
And that's his-- Half the time
he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

1402
01:57:38,814 --> 01:57:42,113
And today,

1403
01:57:42,184 --> 01:57:45,984
I really started wondering
whether he may have killed Freddie.

1404
01:57:46,055 --> 01:57:49,650
<i>He would get so crazy
if anybody would contradict him.</i>

1405
01:57:49,725 --> 01:57:52,421
Well, you know that.
You know that.

1406
01:57:52,495 --> 01:57:55,123
<i>You know that.</i>

1407
01:57:55,197 --> 01:57:57,461
<i>And that's the irony, Marge.</i>

1408
01:57:57,533 --> 01:57:59,467
I loved you.

1409
01:57:59,535 --> 01:58:01,469
You may as well know, Marge.
I loved you.

1410
01:58:01,537 --> 01:58:04,267
<i>I don't know, maybe it's grotesque of me
to say this now,</i>

1411
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:07,173
<i>so just... write it on a
piece of paper or something...</i>

1412
01:58:07,243 --> 01:58:09,711
<i>and put it in your purse
for a rainy day.</i>

1413
01:58:09,779 --> 01:58:14,011
"Tom loves me. Tom loves me."

1414
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:16,449
- Why do you have Dickie's rings?
- I told you.

1415
01:58:16,519 --> 01:58:19,613
- He gave them to me.
- Why? When?

1416
01:58:19,688 --> 01:58:22,714
<i>I feel as if you haven't been listening
to anything I've been saying to you.</i>

1417
01:58:22,792 --> 01:58:26,057
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

1418
01:58:26,128 --> 01:58:28,460
- It's all true.
- I don't believe...

1419
01:58:28,531 --> 01:58:32,934
a single word you've said.

1420
01:58:33,002 --> 01:58:35,732
You're shivering, Marge.
Look at you.

1421
01:58:35,805 --> 01:58:39,605
<i>Marge, can I hold you?</i>

1422
01:58:39,675 --> 01:58:41,643
Will you let me hold you?

1423
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:43,812
<i>Marge?</i>

1424
01:58:43,945 --> 01:58:47,005
- Peter! Thank God you're here.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

1425
01:58:47,081 --> 01:58:50,414
<i>Get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Please!</i>

1426
01:58:50,485 --> 01:58:55,320
<i>Tom, are you okay?</i>

1427
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:58,518
You try. You try talking to her.

1428
01:58:59,594 --> 01:59:01,687
- <i>Tom?</i>
- I give up.

1429
01:59:01,763 --> 01:59:04,357
<i>Tell me what's going on. Tom!</i>

1430
01:59:04,432 --> 01:59:06,900
- <i>What did I ever do to her?</i>
- Listen--

1431
01:59:06,968 --> 01:59:10,096
<i>Have her tell you one thing
that I've ever done to her.</i>

1432
01:59:10,171 --> 01:59:12,867
You can't be angry with her.

1433
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:15,876
She's confused,
and she needs someone to blame.

1434
01:59:15,944 --> 01:59:17,878
So she blames you.

1435
01:59:17,946 --> 01:59:20,506
I'll go back home and talk to her.

1436
01:59:20,582 --> 01:59:23,073
As for you,

1437
01:59:23,151 --> 01:59:25,779
either get a safety razor
or grow a beard.

1438
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,963
- Is Mr. Greenleaf here?
- Mr. Ripley?

1439
01:59:42,036 --> 01:59:44,732
- Yes.
- I'm Alvin MacCarron.

1440
01:59:47,408 --> 01:59:50,104
<i>I don't know, I don't know.
I just know it.</i>

1441
01:59:50,178 --> 01:59:53,113
<i>Marge, there's female intuition
and then there are facts.</i>

1442
01:59:55,683 --> 01:59:57,617
- Tom.
- <i>Sir.</i>

1443
01:59:57,685 --> 02:00:00,415
Marge, you should have waited.
I didn't--

1444
02:00:00,488 --> 02:00:03,150
<i>Didn't Peter say I'd come by
and pick you up?</i>

1445
02:00:04,292 --> 02:00:06,886
Marge has been telling us
about the rings.

1446
02:00:06,961 --> 02:00:09,452
<i>Yes, I feel ridiculous
I didn't mention them yesterday.</i>

1447
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:11,964
I clean forgot. Ridiculous.

1448
02:00:14,535 --> 02:00:18,835
Perhaps you didn't mention them because
there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

1449
02:00:20,909 --> 02:00:24,174
<i>I'm going to take Marge for a walk.
Tom, Mr. MacCarron needs to talk to you.</i>

1450
02:00:24,245 --> 02:00:26,475
There's no need. We could go to the bar.
There's no need.

1451
02:00:26,547 --> 02:00:28,742
No, no.

1452
02:00:28,816 --> 02:00:31,080
<i>I think you should stay here.</i>

1453
02:00:52,941 --> 02:00:55,432
I could probably see my room from here.

1454
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:57,444
I can see my house.

1455
02:00:59,447 --> 02:01:03,577
When you see where you live from a distance,
it's like a dream, isn't it?

1456
02:01:03,651 --> 02:01:05,915
I don't care for B.S.

1457
02:01:05,987 --> 02:01:08,615
I don't care to hear it.
I don't care to speak it.

1458
02:01:10,858 --> 02:01:13,122
- Okay.
- Did you know that at Princeton...

1459
02:01:13,194 --> 02:01:15,526
Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?

1460
02:01:16,597 --> 02:01:18,622
<i>At a party over some girl.</i>

1461
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:22,568
<i>Kicked the kid several times in the head,
put him in the hospital.</i>

1462
02:01:22,637 --> 02:01:26,471
Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw,
lost some hearing.

1463
02:01:26,541 --> 02:01:29,840
<i>Why do you think Dickie's father
sent him to Europe in the first place?</i>

1464
02:01:32,547 --> 02:01:36,745
The Rome police didn't think
to ask Mr. Greenleaf.

1465
02:01:36,818 --> 02:01:39,810
Nor did they think to check
on whether a Thomas Ripley...

1466
02:01:39,887 --> 02:01:43,050
<i>had ever been a student
at Princeton University.</i>

1467
02:01:43,124 --> 02:01:47,754
Oh, I turned up a Tom Ripley...

1468
02:01:47,829 --> 02:01:51,925
who had been a piano tuner
in the music department.

1469
02:01:53,001 --> 02:01:55,094
You see, in America,

1470
02:01:55,169 --> 02:01:59,697
we are taught to check a fact
before it becomes a fact.

1471
02:01:59,774 --> 02:02:02,174
We're taught to nose around.

1472
02:02:02,243 --> 02:02:05,110
When a girl drowns herself,

1473
02:02:05,179 --> 02:02:07,579
find out if that girl is pregnant.

1474
02:02:07,648 --> 02:02:10,583
<i>Find out if Dickie
had an embarrassment there.</i>

1475
02:02:11,986 --> 02:02:15,353
Mr. Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
He really does.

1476
02:02:15,423 --> 02:02:18,483
Marge--
She has a hundred theories.

1477
02:02:18,559 --> 02:02:21,494
There are a few things
that she doesn't know.

1478
02:02:21,562 --> 02:02:23,553
We hope she never knows.

1479
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:25,861
I hope she never knows.

1480
02:02:25,933 --> 02:02:28,424
Three different people...

1481
02:02:28,503 --> 02:02:32,064
saw Dickie get into Freddie's car.

1482
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:35,439
One man, who will not testify...

1483
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:38,445
because he was jumping
somebody else's wife at the time,

1484
02:02:38,513 --> 02:02:42,506
saw Dickie removing license plates
from a red sports car.

1485
02:02:42,583 --> 02:02:46,576
The police know about this man
because he happens to be a policeman.

1486
02:02:48,623 --> 02:02:52,081
I found these in the basement
of Dickie's apartment.

1487
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:54,253
They belong to Freddie's car.

1488
02:02:54,328 --> 02:02:58,628
Mr. Greenleaf has asked me...

1489
02:02:58,699 --> 02:03:01,600
to lose these in the canal this evening.

1490
02:03:06,774 --> 02:03:09,641
Mr. Greenleaf feels that
there was a silent promise...

1491
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:12,873
in Dickie's letter to you
which he intends to honor.

1492
02:03:12,947 --> 02:03:15,507
<i>He also intends to transfer
a good portion...</i>

1493
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:20,316
of Dickie's income from his trust
into your name.

1494
02:03:20,388 --> 02:03:22,481
<i>He does not intend...</i>

1495
02:03:22,557 --> 02:03:26,015
<i>to give the Italians any information
about Dickie's past.</i>

1496
02:03:27,962 --> 02:03:31,796
He's rather hoping that...
you will feel the same.

1497
02:03:49,817 --> 02:03:51,751
- Thank you so much, Tom.
- Sir.

1498
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:53,753
Good-bye.

1499
02:03:58,392 --> 02:04:02,692
Marge, I feel I never should have said
those things to you the other evening.

1500
02:04:02,763 --> 02:04:06,790
I was pretty flustered, and the rings--
And you looked so--

1501
02:04:06,868 --> 02:04:09,132
I don't know.

1502
02:04:09,203 --> 02:04:13,264
But I hope that note goes
in your purse to New York...

1503
02:04:13,341 --> 02:04:15,809
for a rainy day.

1504
02:04:17,378 --> 02:04:21,075
- What are you gonna do now, Tom?
- I don't know.

1505
02:04:21,149 --> 02:04:23,276
Peter has a concert in Athens next month,

1506
02:04:23,351 --> 02:04:25,945
so he asked me to come along 
and help out.

1507
02:04:28,523 --> 02:04:30,457
He says good-bye.

1508
02:04:30,525 --> 02:04:32,493
By the way,
he was in rehearsal so he couldn't--

1509
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:36,758
Why do I think there's never been
a Ripley rainy day?

1510
02:04:36,831 --> 02:04:39,425
What?

1511
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:43,231
I know it was you.
I know it was you.

1512
02:04:43,304 --> 02:04:46,137
I know it was you!
I know it was you!

1513
02:04:46,207 --> 02:04:49,870
- Marge, Marge. Please!
- I know you killed Dickie!

1514
02:04:49,944 --> 02:04:51,878
- Marge!
- I know! No!

1515
02:04:51,946 --> 02:04:55,438
I know it was you!

1516
02:04:55,516 --> 02:04:57,541
Marge. Marge, please.

1517
02:04:57,618 --> 02:05:00,280
It's not Tom. Really.

1518
02:05:08,863 --> 02:05:12,128
<i>We are called gondoleri</i>

1519
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:16,159
<i>But that's a vagary
It's quite honorary</i>

1520
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:21,708
<i>The trade that we ply</i>

1521
02:05:21,841 --> 02:05:24,571
Ask me what I want to change
about this moment.

1522
02:05:24,644 --> 02:05:27,112
I don't know. What do you want
to change about this moment?

1523
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:28,875
Nothing.

1524
02:05:32,552 --> 02:05:35,350
I'm freezing. Coming down?

1525
02:05:35,421 --> 02:05:38,254
Later. I want to catch the sunset.

1526
02:05:38,324 --> 02:05:42,590
- You're mad.
- I am.

1527
02:05:52,505 --> 02:05:54,439
<i>Dickie?</i>

1528
02:05:57,643 --> 02:05:59,577
<i>Dickie?</i>

1529
02:06:02,982 --> 02:06:04,916
<i>Dickie!</i>

1530
02:06:15,995 --> 02:06:17,929
Oh, my God.

1531
02:06:19,899 --> 02:06:21,833
Hello, Meredith.

1532
02:06:24,971 --> 02:06:27,303
I was looking at you.

1533
02:06:27,373 --> 02:06:30,809
<i>Your clothes.
I wouldn't have known you.</i>

1534
02:06:30,877 --> 02:06:33,641
<i>Well, you spotted me,
so you get the reward.</i>

1535
02:06:35,314 --> 02:06:37,976
- What?
- Just kidding.

1536
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:42,009
- Are you alone?
- Oh.

1537
02:06:42,088 --> 02:06:45,114
<i>Hardly. Couldn't be less alone.</i>

1538
02:06:45,191 --> 02:06:47,853
- Aunt Joan.
- And "co."

1539
02:06:50,997 --> 02:06:52,965
A lot of "co."

1540
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:57,228
Oh, God.

1541
02:06:57,303 --> 02:07:00,397
<i>You know, seeing you again, I--</i>

1542
02:07:02,475 --> 02:07:05,740
I've thought about you...

1543
02:07:05,812 --> 02:07:07,746
so much.

1544
02:07:07,814 --> 02:07:09,748
And I've thought about you.

1545
02:07:11,818 --> 02:07:15,254
Yeah, well, when I've thought about you,
I was mostly hating you.

1546
02:07:21,861 --> 02:07:23,829
Where have you been hiding?

1547
02:07:23,896 --> 02:07:27,423
I haven't been hiding.

1548
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,832
I've been in police custody.

1549
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:34,105
They've been trying to flush out
Freddie's killer.

1550
02:07:34,173 --> 02:07:37,370
- You're kidding.
- They're giving me this vacation,

1551
02:07:37,443 --> 02:07:39,741
which is why the getup.

1552
02:07:39,812 --> 02:07:41,973
Which is why you haven't heard from me.

1553
02:07:42,048 --> 02:07:44,346
You know, the whole world
thinks you killed Freddie.

1554
02:07:44,417 --> 02:07:47,511
- Oh! It's terrible.
- I know.

1555
02:07:47,587 --> 02:07:50,283
Listen, I can't talk now. Um, later?

1556
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:57,627
Later? Later?

1557
02:08:07,874 --> 02:08:09,808
So--

1558
02:08:15,081 --> 02:08:17,743
Are you traveling under "R"?

1559
02:08:17,817 --> 02:08:20,877
You know what? I am.

1560
02:08:23,956 --> 02:08:28,325
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-Kingsley?
I bet you are.

1561
02:08:28,394 --> 02:08:31,022
My aunt thought she saw him.

1562
02:08:31,097 --> 02:08:33,224
Peter Smith-Kingsley?
No, I--

1563
02:08:33,299 --> 02:08:36,928
I haven't seen him in months.

1564
02:08:37,003 --> 02:08:38,937
No, I'm alone.

1565
02:08:58,724 --> 02:09:00,658
Hi.

1566
02:09:03,362 --> 02:09:05,887
- How was it?
- It was good.

1567
02:09:05,965 --> 02:09:07,899
But I'll tell you something.

1568
02:09:07,967 --> 02:09:11,698
I want us to stay in here
for the rest of the trip.

1569
02:09:16,275 --> 02:09:19,005
Was that Meredith?

1570
02:09:20,513 --> 02:09:22,447
Was who Meredith?

1571
02:09:22,515 --> 02:09:26,246
Meredith Logue. You were kissing someone.
It looked like Meredith.

1572
02:09:32,959 --> 02:09:36,451
I came out to find you.

1573
02:09:36,529 --> 02:09:38,963
Oh, hardly kissing.

1574
02:09:40,366 --> 02:09:43,494
- Kissing off.
- It didn't look that way.

1575
02:09:45,004 --> 02:09:47,029
You know? From a distance?

1576
02:09:52,011 --> 02:09:54,673
I lied... to her.

1577
02:09:55,915 --> 02:09:58,543
<i>She thought she'd seen you.</i>

1578
02:09:58,617 --> 02:10:00,551
Why lie?

1579
02:10:00,619 --> 02:10:05,556
Dickie and Peter together.
That's just too good gossip.

1580
02:10:05,624 --> 02:10:07,558
Or Tom and Peter, even.

1581
02:10:07,626 --> 02:10:10,151
That would be even better gossip.

1582
02:10:10,229 --> 02:10:12,493
Really? Why?

1583
02:10:17,336 --> 02:10:21,773
I-I, um-- I'm completely lost.

1584
02:10:24,443 --> 02:10:26,377
I know.

1585
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:30,808
I'm sorry, Peter.

1586
02:10:30,883 --> 02:10:32,851
I'm lost.

1587
02:10:35,955 --> 02:10:39,356
I'm gonna be stuck in the basement,
aren't I?

1588
02:10:39,425 --> 02:10:42,724
<i>Aren't I?</i>

1589
02:10:42,795 --> 02:10:44,729
That's my--

1590
02:10:47,833 --> 02:10:49,767
Terrible...

1591
02:10:51,103 --> 02:10:53,196
and alone...

1592
02:10:53,272 --> 02:10:56,708
and dark.

1593
02:10:56,776 --> 02:10:59,472
And I've lied...

1594
02:10:59,545 --> 02:11:02,639
about who I am...

1595
02:11:02,715 --> 02:11:04,706
and where I am.

1596
02:11:04,784 --> 02:11:07,309
Now no one'll ever find me.

1597
02:11:08,888 --> 02:11:11,220
What do you mean,
lied about who you are?

1598
02:11:11,290 --> 02:11:13,952
I always thought it'd be better...

1599
02:11:14,026 --> 02:11:17,120
to be a fake somebody...

1600
02:11:17,196 --> 02:11:20,131
than a real nobody.

1601
02:11:20,199 --> 02:11:23,066
<i>What are you talking about?
You're not a nobody.</i>

1602
02:11:23,135 --> 02:11:25,660
That's the last thing you are.

1603
02:11:33,079 --> 02:11:36,640
<i>Peter.</i>

1604
02:11:36,715 --> 02:11:39,275
Tell me some good things
about Tom Ripley.

1605
02:11:41,187 --> 02:11:43,815
No, don't get up.
Don't get up. Don't get up.

1606
02:11:46,759 --> 02:11:48,693
Just--

1607
02:11:51,497 --> 02:11:55,228
Just tell me some nice things...
about Tom Ripley.

1608
02:11:58,337 --> 02:12:01,397
"Good things about Tom Ripley."

1609
02:12:03,342 --> 02:12:05,537
That could take me some time.

1610
02:12:08,081 --> 02:12:11,949
Tom is talented. Tom is tender.

1611
02:12:13,352 --> 02:12:15,320
Tom is beautiful.

1612
02:12:15,388 --> 02:12:17,822
You're such a liar.

1613
02:12:21,127 --> 02:12:24,528
Tom is-- Tom is a mystery.

1614
02:12:30,103 --> 02:12:32,663
<i>Tom is not a nobody.</i>

1615
02:12:36,275 --> 02:12:40,143
<i>Tom has secrets
he doesn't want to tell me,</i>

1616
02:12:40,213 --> 02:12:42,579
<i>and I wish he would.</i>

1617
02:12:46,752 --> 02:12:49,186
<i>Tom has nightmares.</i>

1618
02:12:53,259 --> 02:12:55,693
<i>That's not a good thing.</i>

1619
02:13:00,299 --> 02:13:02,893
<i>Tom has someone to love him.</i>

1620
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:06,904
<i>That is a good thing.</i>

1621
02:13:09,742 --> 02:13:14,202
<i>Mmm. Tom is crushing me.</i>

1622
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:17,647
<i>Tom is crushing me.</i>

1623
02:13:17,717 --> 02:13:21,551
<i>Tom. Tom, you're crush--</i>

1624
02:13:21,621 --> 02:13:24,522
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1625
02:13:24,590 --> 02:13:26,455
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1626
02:13:26,526 --> 02:13:28,460
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1627
02:13:35,635 --> 02:13:38,069
<i>Oh, God! Peter.</i>

1628
02:16:07,286 --> 02:16:09,754
<i>You don't know</i>

1629
02:16:09,822 --> 02:16:15,055
<i>What love is</i>

1630
02:16:15,127 --> 02:16:20,963
<i>Until you know the meaning
of the blues</i>

1631
02:16:23,002 --> 02:16:26,301
<i>Till you love the love</i>

1632
02:16:26,372 --> 02:16:30,536
<i>You had to lose</i>

1633
02:16:30,609 --> 02:16:32,577
<i>You don't know</i>

1634
02:16:32,645 --> 02:16:35,978
<i>What love is</i>

1635
02:16:38,584 --> 02:16:43,988
<i>You don't know how lips hurt</i>

1636
02:16:46,192 --> 02:16:48,319
<i>Until you've kissed</i>

1637
02:16:48,394 --> 02:16:54,026
<i>And had to pay the cost</i>

1638
02:16:54,099 --> 02:16:57,193
<i>Until you've flipped your heart</i>

1639
02:16:57,269 --> 02:17:01,968
<i>And found you've lost</i>

1640
02:17:02,041 --> 02:17:06,705
<i>You don't know what love is</i>

1641
02:17:10,583 --> 02:17:12,517
<i>You know</i>

1642
02:17:12,585 --> 02:17:18,046
<i>How a lost heart feels</i>

1643
02:17:18,123 --> 02:17:22,787
<i>The very thought of reminiscing</i>

1644
02:17:26,332 --> 02:17:28,857
<i>And how those lips</i>

1645
02:17:28,934 --> 02:17:33,394
<i>With a taste for tears</i>

1646
02:17:33,472 --> 02:17:36,999
<i>Soon lose their taste</i>

1647
02:17:37,076 --> 02:17:40,773
<i>For kissing</i>

1648
02:17:42,514 --> 02:17:45,039
<i>You don't know</i>

1649
02:17:45,117 --> 02:17:48,609
<i>How hearts burn</i>

1650
02:17:50,456 --> 02:17:52,515
<i>A love that cannot live</i>

1651
02:17:52,591 --> 02:17:56,254
<i>But never dies</i>

1652
02:17:58,063 --> 02:18:01,897
<i>Until you've reached dawn</i>

1653
02:18:01,967 --> 02:18:04,868
<i>With sleepless eyes</i>

1654
02:18:04,937 --> 02:18:08,429
<i>You don't know</i>

1655
02:18:08,507 --> 02:18:11,567
<i>What love is</i>

1656
02:18:11,644 --> 02:18:16,513
<i>You don't know</i>

1657
02:18:16,582 --> 02:18:18,573
<i>What love is</i>

1658
02:18:20,586 --> 02:18:24,386
<i>And don't know</i>

1659
02:18:24,456 --> 02:18:27,425
<i>What love is</i>

1660
02:18:27,493 --> 02:18:31,054
<i>You don't know</i>

1661
02:18:31,130 --> 02:18:33,564
<i>You don't know</i>

1662
02:18:33,632 --> 02:18:35,566
<i>What love is</i>
