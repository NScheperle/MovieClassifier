1
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:31,250
In accordance with the regulations
of the state of Mississippi...

2
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:34,210
...we gather today to lay to rest...

3
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:38,470
...the remains of inmates
R. Gibson, number 4316...

4
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,850
...and C. Banks, number 4317.

5
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:46,683
'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.'

6
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,525
May God have mercy on their souls.

7
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,899
- Amen.
- Amen.

8
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,901
You can go ahead, fellas.

9
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,283
Look like you finally free now, boys.

10
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,626
Finally free.

11
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,087
Friends of yours, old-timer?

12
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:16,131
Let's just say
we spent some time together.

13
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:21,134
Now, why do I get the feeling when you
say 'some time,' you mean some time.

14
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:24,181
I'd been here a good while
when they come.

15
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,227
They come here, must've been 1932.

16
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:30,148
- Man!
- Shit, that's like... Wait a minute.

17
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:32,355
That's 65 years, son.

18
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,645
Shit.

19
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,316
Didn't they burn in that fire yesterday?

20
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,825
Listen, man, I seen them niggers
before they put them in the box.

21
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,617
And when I tell you, them niggers,
they was bacon burnt.

22
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,913
It was like from the X Files, man.

23
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,995
What you got in that bottle anyway?

24
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,670
This is Rayford's special recipe.

25
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,303
He had what we call exacting standards
when it comes to the hootch.

26
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,721
- So, what were they, bootleggers?
- Something like that.

27
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:16,275
- Hank, my man, how you doin'?
- No, not tonight, Ray.

28
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:19,283
- Spanky's not happy with you.
- Is Spanky here?

29
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:22,488
Find a place where they let you
in the front door.

30
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:24,453
Wait.

31
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,913
Remember I bought your girl
the alligator shoes?

32
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,828
What's wrong? I came through for you!

33
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,704
She was wearin' pigskin when I met her.
She's in alligator now. Let me in.

34
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,041
Yeah, that's how it goes, brother.

35
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,507
Thank you, man. I appreciate it.

36
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:40,175
- How does this tie look?
- Lookin' sharp, man.

37
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,138
I feel lucky tonight, too.

38
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:59,021
- Here's to your new job down at the bank.
- Thank you.

39
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:01,862
I always knew you'd make something
of yourself.

40
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,783
- With my first paycheck, I'll buy...
- What, baby?

41
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,624
Season tickets to the Yankees,
right on the first base line.

42
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:13,287
What's wrong?

43
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,382
I was hoping you were gonna say
an engagement ring, Claude.

44
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:19,753
- Engagement ring?
- That's what respectable folks do.

45
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,759
Get a job, get married, start having babies.

46
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:27,016
Isn't that what you want?

47
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:30,187
I just don't see no reason
to rush into things.

48
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:33,808
I got to clean this. I'll be right back, baby.

49
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,499
- Good evening, sir.
- Can I have a towel, please?

50
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,662
- Of course.
- Look at this.

51
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,960
Hey, there ain't no reason to get violent.
I tried to call.

52
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,253
Sit your ass down.

53
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,967
Congratulations.
You finally got yourself a job.

54
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:08,261
Now you can pay Mr. Riley
that 50 bucks you owe him.

55
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,479
- I got a bill to pay out there.
- Lookie here.

56
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:16,107
- $22.
- Not bad... for a start.

57
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:20,145
That's two weeks' pay. I'm with my girl.
You gotta leave me something.

58
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:24,533
- How about your legs?
- My legs? Those are good.

59
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:26,989
That's good.

60
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:29,578
I'll keep the legs.

61
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:33,914
Excuse me.

62
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:36,707
How'd he get in here?

63
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:37,793
Evenin'.

64
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,932
- You got any of that French shit?
- Yeah, bro.

65
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,273
That's the one there.

66
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:59,150
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

67
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:01,980
- Do I smell French?
- That's it.

68
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,987
- Here, you keep the change.
- Thank you.

69
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,704
- Hey, don't I know you?
- I don't think so.

70
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:20,873
- Yes, I know you. What is your name?
- Claude Banks.

71
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,137
Claude Banks! Hey, it's me, Ray Gibson.

72
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,343
We went to high school. How you doin'?

73
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,140
- You went to Monroe?
- Yes! How you doing?

74
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,269
You lookin' all sharp.
Good to see colored folks doin' good.

75
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,265
I went to Jefferson.

76
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,600
You must have another Claude Banks
in mind.

77
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:42,399
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. My mistake.

78
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,831
Are you wearin' that dress?

79
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,042
Hey, what's goin' on?

80
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,580
Is it about my tab?
Don't worry, it's covered.

81
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,750
It's hot in here tonight. Hot.

82
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:08,131
This ain't about your tab.
You got bigger problems than that.

83
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,132
Hold up one second...

84
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,261
You shouldn't have run numbers
on Spanky's side of Broadway.

85
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:16,638
- I think we gotta get out of here.
- Excuse me, sir, your bill.

86
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:20,182
The bill? Of course, the bill.

87
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:23,980
How can I forget the bill?
Such an incredibly large bill.

88
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,368
Just tell me where you want me to go.

89
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,618
Get over here.

90
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:37,870
- You took my ankle.
- All right, that's not nice.

91
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:39,872
Yeah, right?

92
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,955
What do you think they're gonna do to us?

93
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:46,087
What'd you do, dine and ditch?

94
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,920
- Over ten bucks?
- Yeah.

95
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,302
- Probably just a thumb.
- Who is he?

96
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,183
Friend of yours?

97
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,225
I never met this man before tonight.

98
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:58,763
He's a lowlife that hangs around
in bathrooms pickpocketing people.

99
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,769
I'm a professional man.

100
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:04,350
I got a job that starts on Monday.

101
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,983
I'll pay you back with my first paycheck,
with interest.

102
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,316
I won't tell you how to run your business...

103
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,494
...but if you cut off my fingers,
you won't get nothing.

104
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:17,037
Working on adding machines,
I got to be whole.

105
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,533
I need these for prayin'!

106
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:23,287
- Drop him.
- What does 'drop him' mean?

107
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,255
This ain't the way you treat somebody.

108
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:29,047
Spanky, you ain't got to do that
to that guy.

109
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,841
He's a square.
He didn't know who he was fucking with.

110
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,723
It's filthy down there.

111
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,217
Damn, there's a rat. I hate rats.

112
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:40,641
But you do.
What does that say about you?

113
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,567
What does that say about me?

114
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:47,483
I'm just tryin' to get by.
You remember when you started out?

115
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,852
Nigger, please.

116
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,617
Wait a second.

117
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,496
I want you to see this. Check this out.

118
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:01,710
- I got access to that.
- Is that some more of your bathtub brew?

119
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:04,457
Hell, no, this come up from the Mississippi.

120
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:07,085
I can get more. I want to go into business.

121
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,259
Under present circumstances,
I think I may want a partner, OK?

122
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:13,180
I was supposed to wear this suit
on Monday!

123
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,387
If you give me the front money
and a truck...

124
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,307
...I can get there in two or three days,
if somebody helps me with the driving.

125
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:29,352
- Come on, now!
- Come on, Spank.

126
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,409
I'm gonna tell you something.

127
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:42,248
- You fuck me on this, I'll spare no expense.
- I understand.

128
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,418
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.

129
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,797
- You got a deal.
- All right.

130
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,047
Pick a man and get outta here.

131
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,625
With all due respect to you gentlemen...

132
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:54,008
...I think I'm gonna just take the choirboy.

133
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,840
You got to be crazy.

134
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:59,799
At least pick somebody
who can watch your back.

135
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:03,097
I want someone who won't shoot me
once the truck's full.

136
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:05,976
- Lift him.
- Not that you'd do that.

137
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,772
- Lift him!
- You know what I mean.

138
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:12,155
There you go.

139
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,655
Sure he ain't dead?

140
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:22,790
Sure hope you can drive.

141
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:31,876
This rum run we're doin' is gonna really
improve my relationship with Spanky.

142
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:36,096
Good man to have on your side.
He's got capital connections.

143
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:39,718
I ain't got capital yet, but I will.

144
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,600
Then I'll have my own place.

145
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,556
Don't get me wrong, I like Spanky's.
I want my own.

146
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,604
I'm gonna call my place...

147
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,897
...Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

148
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:52,686
Don't that sound like a place
where it's fun? Sound excitin'.

149
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:55,438
Ray's Boom-Boom Room. I like that.

150
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:59,362
Wouldn't you want to check out
a place like that?

151
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:02,075
Hell, you'd want to.

152
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,535
The Boom-Boom Room.

153
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,492
What you think?

154
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,131
You ain't said nothin' since we left.

155
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:16,131
The least you can do is give me
friendly conversation.

156
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,135
I don't want a friendly conversation.
I don't want to be your friend.

157
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:24,895
I just want to do this thing and get back
to New York in time to start my job.

158
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,102
What the hell kind of job you got?

159
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:31,692
If you must know,
bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan.

160
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:35,947
What's so funny?

161
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:38,773
I'm just laughing at myself. Excuse me.

162
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,988
No, you found something very amusing.
What's so funny?

163
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:46,119
'Bank teller' just sounds like ladies' work,
I always picture a woman doing that.

164
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,494
Maybe I should dig around
in other people's pockets for money.

165
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,912
It's obviously been highly successful
for you.

166
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,378
You'd be surprised what you find there.

167
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:57,552
I've never heard of a man
settin' out to be a bank teller.

168
00:12:57,637 --> 00:13:00,044
This time next year, I'll be a loan officer.

169
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,677
So, I go to the bank for a loan...

170
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,760
...I gotta deal with a tight-ass like you?

171
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,343
- That's right.
- Well, how do I get a loan?

172
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,645
- You?
- Yes, me. What's 'you'?

173
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,809
I can't get no money?

174
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:15,685
- You need collateral.
- What, you think I ain't got collateral?

175
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:20,107
I have... Look at this. What about this?

176
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:23,866
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?

177
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,488
I ain't steal that. My daddy gave it to me.

178
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,824
Who'd he steal it from?

179
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,547
Watch what you say about my daddy.
My daddy's dead.

180
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,335
Say what you want about me.
Don't drag my daddy into it.

181
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:38,794
This watch is sterling silver.
It's top-shelf, top of the line.

182
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:43,216
It's very near and dear to my heart,
so no wisecracks or I'll whup your ass.

183
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,888
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied.

184
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,813
Fuck you. I'll take my business elsewhere.

185
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,599
And for future references, you will not
be welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

186
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:57,730
- There's no Boom-Boom Room.
- When there is one.

187
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:01,654
When there's one, don't come,
'cause you ain't gettin' in.

188
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,627
- Smell that?
- Yeah, I smell something.

189
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:27,768
- Smells good, right?
- I think we should go to another place.

190
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,725
The ambiance ain't really very welcoming.

191
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:35,060
Are you kiddin'? Tell me you don't want
one of these pies right here.

192
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:37,648
Them pies look good,
but I kinda lost my appetite.

193
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:41,070
- When I came in, my appetite left.
- Good afternoon, Billy.

194
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:45,118
We'd like some coffee
and a couple slices of pie.

195
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,486
How do you know my name is Billy?

196
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,707
It says it right there on your shirt.

197
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:57,127
If you boys can read so good, how come
you missed that sign on the door?

198
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:01,462
That sign on the door...

199
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,470
Why didn't we see that sign
that say 'No Coloreds Allowed'?

200
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,093
We rushed in.
We was really hungry, so we missed it.

201
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,223
- We see it now, so bye.
- Look, ma'am...

202
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,552
...we've been traveling all day.
- Let's go.

203
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:15,264
All we want is some coffee
and a couple slices of pie, all right?

204
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:18,110
No. These are whites-only pies.

205
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,193
- Well, do you have any Negro pies?
- Claude, come on.

206
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,944
This woman ain't got the recipe to it.
Where would she get that?

207
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:29,492
At another establishment
we can get us some pies.

208
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,036
- How far to the next town?
- Thirty-five miles.

209
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,328
I'm not driving no 35 miles to get no pie.

210
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,456
Lady! Ma'am! Okay?

211
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:41,460
Now we want some pie. We are hungry.

212
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,466
Billy, we want some pie.

213
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,929
- Let me take care of this.
- Someone must die 'cause we want pie?

214
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,423
Let me take care of 'em.

215
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,265
We're from New York,
my name's Ray Gibson.

216
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:59,317
How much will it cost to turn one of them
white-only pies into nigger pie?

217
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:02,107
How about I turn y'all into nigger pie?

218
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,735
- So you said about 35...
- 35 miles.

219
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:07,991
We'll find another establishment
down the road.

220
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:11,994
Yeah, I didn't know white folks
so serious about pie down here.

221
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,849
- Hey, we're lookin' for Slim.
- You found him.

222
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:36,469
That's it, fellas.
Thirty-six cases of Mississippi's finest.

223
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:42,273
- Five bucks a case. That's $180.
- All right.

224
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:44,935
- What do we got?
- Come on. Pay the man.

225
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:49,398
That music's hot.
What goes on down there?

226
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,028
That there's Natchez-Under-The-Hill.

227
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:53,948
Colored folks welcome down there?

228
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,207
- Green's the only color that matters there.
- Is that right?

229
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:59,494
They got gambling, girls.

230
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,123
- You boys ought to check it out.
- Maybe we will. Nice doing business...

231
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:07,839
Let's go have ourselves a reward,
see what's shaking.

232
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,883
- Reward?
- There's people there having a good time.

233
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,465
I wanna be one of 'em.
I want you to be one of 'em.

234
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,474
Let me tell you something. Listen.
Monday, you can go be a bank teller.

235
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:20,814
Tonight, you're a bootlegger
with a truckload of hootch...

236
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,728
...and a fistful of cash.

237
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:25,110
That's gas money, Ray.

238
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:27,321
Come on. Think.

239
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:32,449
Man, you are incredible. Tell you what.
Here's $2.

240
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:35,491
You stay here, watch the truck.
I'm gonna go have fun.

241
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:38,073
I got the keys,
if you want to leave me in the woods.

242
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,955
I know how you think, you motherfucker.

243
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:46,084
This looks like something here.

244
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:50,885
I'll keep an eye on you.
Make sure you don't do nothin' stupid.

245
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,632
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

246
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:56,425
Well, step lively.
Don't want them to think I'm from here.

247
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,306
They'll know by how I walk,
I ain't from around here.

248
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:01,105
'Cause I'm from New York City!

249
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,681
- How y'all doing?
- What's up, country boy?

250
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,195
Tens over nines.

251
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,173
I ain't never seen you in here before.

252
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:34,514
That's 'cause I ain't never been
in here before.

253
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,090
My name's Sylvia. What's your name?

254
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:44,263
- Can't you remember your own name?
- I know it begins with a 'C.'

255
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:47,144
Well, Mr. 'C.'

256
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:52,318
How about buyin' a gal a drink?
Two bourbons.

257
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:57,491
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep
an eye on my friend over there.

258
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:00,701
He look like he can take care of hisself.

259
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:32,520
Claude.

260
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:37,819
That's my name... Claude.

261
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,867
You know that's never
happened to me before.

262
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,834
You're cute.

263
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:47,332
Thank you.

264
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,798
You got any money, Claude?

265
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:55,304
Two dollars, but I need that to get home.

266
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,891
What's wrong?

267
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:02,427
What you wanna go home for?

268
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,683
It's so early.

269
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,978
I'll take one.

270
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:12,900
- One for New York.
- Thank you. Me's want one.

271
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:15,154
- Can I get that for you?
- Thanks, baby.

272
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:17,862
- Give me a deuce.
- Here you go, honey.

273
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:22,031
- Thank you.
- All right.

274
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,831
- You all want to pick up this country pace?
- Bet's to you, sir.

275
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,336
- Bet a dollar.
- I'll sees that.

276
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:34,503
You sees that.

277
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:38,087
Well, I sees that dollar, and I raise you $2.

278
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:40,681
Is 'sees' a word?

279
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,593
- All right now.
- I'm out.

280
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,187
You goin' back to the farm now?
Pick your tomatoes?

281
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:52,193
I'll see the two.

282
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:57,109
And I raise you ten.

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,575
Damn. Out.

284
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,999
Mr. Hancock, I don't think
I have any more money.

285
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,662
- Big city boy.
- Well, that's too bad.

286
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,342
Now, hold on.

287
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,045
Just give me two seconds.

288
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:40,320
Top shelf.

289
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,696
It look good to me.

290
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:44,989
I think that'll cover it.

291
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:46,530
Call.

292
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:56,090
I got a full boat
with the ladies doin' the paddlin'.

293
00:21:56,926 --> 00:22:00,461
I don't think they come in
much stronger than that, sir.

294
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:02,973
Four treys.

295
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:06,387
What the fuck?

296
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,431
Broke again.

297
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:11,480
New York. New York.

298
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,518
Don't take it too hard, New York.
Have a round on me.

299
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:27,831
- Can I get you something, sir?
- No, I'm all right.

300
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:30,038
Hey! What the fuck is this?

301
00:22:30,627 --> 00:22:33,912
- You're hurtin' my arm.
- Where you goin'?

302
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,045
Hell, no! Hey, Hancock!

303
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,302
Oh, shit.

304
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:09,748
My goodness.

305
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,913
My old friend, Winston Hancock.

306
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:19,792
I thought we agreed that
you was gonna leave town.

307
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,837
I was gonna leave, Sheriff Pike...

308
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:30,305
...but your wife, she begged me to stay.

309
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,534
You just committed suicide, boy.

310
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,331
Ray, I've been lookin' for ya.

311
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,219
Guess we better get goin'.

312
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,968
You still got that $2?

313
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,393
Not exactly.

314
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,274
I met this girl.

315
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:20,110
Real nice girl. A God-fearing girl.

316
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:23,781
- The same girl I seen you over here with?
- Yeah.

317
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,700
- Yeah, she looked religious.
- Yeah, well...

318
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:29,986
So you gave her the $2?

319
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,784
She was in a tight spot.
Her mama needs this operation.

320
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:35,709
She ain't have the money for it, and so...

321
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:39,378
The church took up a collection,
but they're short...

322
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,962
- $2 short?
- Uh, yeah.

323
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,214
So I gave it to her.
When the spirit moves me...

324
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:48,257
We both got fucked.
While you was doing God's work...

325
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:52,262
...I was getting jack-legged by a farmer
and one of these waitresses.

326
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:55,637
I know the bitch is in here.
They beat me down to my socks.

327
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,019
You lost all our money in a card game?

328
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:02,022
Fuck the money. It's not even about
the money. I lost my daddy's watch.

329
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:04,270
Fuck that cheap-ass watch.

330
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:08,116
I apologize. You're right, it has to stop.

331
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,404
Once more, I'll take all your fronts out.

332
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:13,654
See how you go back to New York.

333
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:16,500
- That's how you gonna be in the car.
- I'm sorry.

334
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:18,660
Say something about the watch.

335
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:23,629
In fact, just bring up watch. Look like you
was fixin' your mouth to say 'watch.'

336
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,375
I'm gonna whup your ass.
Don't even say 'watch.'

337
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:30,930
Don't say it around me. Say 'little clock'
or some shit. Say 'watch,' I'm gonna dive.

338
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:32,924
How do we get home without money?

339
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:36,018
We got 36 cases of booze.
That's better than money.

340
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:38,762
So we gonna drive home drunk.

341
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,600
- Is that it?
- Let me pay, get out.

342
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:42,731
- Where's the girl who was here?
- What girl?

343
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:47,279
'What girl? ' Next time I come here,
whichever bitch I start choking, that's her.

344
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:52,285
Big-time hustler, came and got girked
by a couple of farmers.

345
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:56,199
Can it, Claude. I'm all shot,
I just wanna get back to New York.

346
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:01,670
Oh, shit.

347
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:05,622
I think he's hurt pretty bad.

348
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:17,433
This guy's dead.

349
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:20,720
I ain't never seen no dead body before.

350
00:26:21,065 --> 00:26:25,811
What are you doin'? The man's been dead
two seconds, and you're in his pocket.

351
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:28,604
- Don't you have any respect?
- It ain't here.

352
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:32,114
- What ain't there?
- My daddy's watch. He took my watch.

353
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:34,858
Motherfucker, you fucked
with the wrong person.

354
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:37,659
- Now look at your ass out here bleeding.
- Hey!

355
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,789
What you boys doin' out here?

356
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:43,914
Hey, how y'all doin'?

357
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:47,955
We're just takin' care of our friend here.

358
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:50,257
What's wrong with this one?

359
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:53,342
- Drink.
- Yeah, he's just a little drunk.

360
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:56,634
- Nothing at all, just a little drunk.
- Nobody drank like old...

361
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:58,434
- Ah, Winston.
...Winston.

362
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,054
Old drunk-ass Winston is always drinking.

363
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:04,224
This fella looks like he's dead.

364
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,396
No.

365
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,444
He's not dead. He's drunk.

366
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,356
He drinks until he passes out.

367
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:13,117
Let's leave him here to sleep it off.

368
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,526
I'm gonna tell his wife we left him.

369
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,656
- Let's go to the car.
- You boys better come with us.

370
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,457
That's right.

371
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,574
We're gonna go to your car then.

372
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:26,208
Let's go. We're gonna go with this guy.

373
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,666
You know what, Ray?

374
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,967
You're responsible for this whole situation.

375
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:34,758
I blame you for everything.

376
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,509
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be home now about to have a hot meal.

377
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:41,721
If not for me, your black ass
would be floating up on a beach.

378
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,482
Remember that, 'my finger
and thumbs for adding' shit?

379
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,353
- I saved your life.
- They think we killed somebody.

380
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:50,231
- This is blood, okay?
- Just shut up. Listen.

381
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,230
Just sit down. Let me work it out.

382
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:54,779
- I got a job, it starts Monday.
- You'll be late.

383
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:58,486
- 'Cause I got to work this whole thing out.
- What the...

384
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,791
- Evening, boys.
- Evening there, Sheriff.

385
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,041
Well, well. What do we have here?

386
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:12,586
Billy Bob and the boys found 'em
under the hill with Winston Hancock.

387
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:16,714
He was dead. Looks like murder.

388
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,641
- Yep, it does.
- Is that right?

389
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:23,474
Looks like they was runnin' hootch.
Got 36 cases of evidence.

390
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:27,022
- How about a little reward, Billy Bob?
- Thank you, sir.

391
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:33,399
Why bother with bootleggin' when we got
a clear-cut case of murder?

392
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:38,528
Sheriff Pike, like I told your associate,
we didn't kill nobody.

393
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,455
He was like that when we found him.
He was already dead.

394
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,947
Now as far as bootleggin' goes...

395
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:48,078
...I happen to work for a very important
man back East.

396
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:53,001
Does the name Spanky Johnson
mean anything to you?

397
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:55,091
Spanky Johnson?

398
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:59,254
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Hey, Sheriff Pike.

399
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:01,555
Sheriff Pike, listen.

400
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:06,436
This guy, Spanky Johnson,
is very well-connected.

401
00:29:06,689 --> 00:29:10,141
Very well-connected.
And if you were to give us a break...

402
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:14,310
...I can guarantee you, he would do
something to show his appreciation.

403
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:16,654
- Now I'm sure.
- Mr. Pike.

404
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,362
You can buy your way out of trouble
in New York City...

405
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,371
...but down here,
we take murder very seriously.

406
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,875
We didn't kill him.
He was dead when we found him.

407
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,041
That's the truth.

408
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,921
The liquor was ours.

409
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:35,915
- There was no breath in him.
- It was our liquor, but the man was dead.

410
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,130
If that's true, you boys don't have anything
to worry about.

411
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:42,057
I guarantee it. I'll see y'all in the morning.

412
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:45,593
You believe us? What time
you gonna be here in the mornin'?

413
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:49,518
- Don't drink all that stuff tonight.
- All right, Sheriff.

414
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:53,815
- See you in the morning.
- He sounded like he believed us.

415
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:57,149
The man's got a point.
We didn't kill nobody.

416
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,565
What about the truckload of booze?

417
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,901
That's Spanky's booze!

418
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:05,743
Tomorrow, I'm gonna tell that judge,
'Judge, we didn't murder nobody.

419
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:07,824
'That was Spanky's booze.'

420
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:11,163
What's the worst that can happen to us?

421
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:12,619
Life!

422
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:16,007
What do you mean, 'life'?
I ain't doin' no life.

423
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:23,424
I didn't kill nobody.
The man was dead when I got there.

424
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,627
Welcome to Mississippi.

425
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:58,085
Here, you will be provided
with ample opportunity...

426
00:30:58,176 --> 00:31:02,090
...to repay your debt to society
through the rigors of hard labor.

427
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,551
We got fields need clearin', roads need
buildin' and ditches need diggin'.

428
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:12,053
You will eat only what you can grow.

429
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:14,936
Your crop don't come in, you go hungry.

430
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:17,818
This here is Camp 8.

431
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,154
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

432
00:31:22,617 --> 00:31:25,783
But whatever you done to get here,
believe me, I'm not impressed.

433
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,827
I've seen it all before.

434
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:32,495
We ain't got no fences here at Camp 8.

435
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,661
We don't need no fences.
We got us the gun line.

436
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,001
Tell 'em about the gun line, boss.

437
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:40,549
This is the gun line.

438
00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:44,761
It runs from shack to shack,
clear around the yard.

439
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:50,222
You are now inside the gun line.

440
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:56,060
You step outside the gun line
without my permission, you will be shot.

441
00:31:56,567 --> 00:32:00,648
You trip and fall over the gun line,
you will be shot.

442
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:03,024
You spit, you pee...

443
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:06,864
...you so much as stick
your Johnson out over the gun line...

444
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:08,821
...you will be shot.

445
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:15,412
And you, Slick,
don't try to run, don't try to escape.

446
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:19,749
One of my trusties
will put a bullet in your head.

447
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:26,002
You prisoners are now the property
of the state of Mississippi...

448
00:32:26,597 --> 00:32:29,468
...which is to say I own your ass.

449
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,763
And in case you haven't met this
handsome young fella...

450
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:34,727
...this is Hoppin' Bob.

451
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:38,391
You run afoul of Bob, you run afoul of me.

452
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:44,146
Everybody, shut up! Right now.

453
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,526
I don't wanna hear a sound.
Got some fresh meat for ya.

454
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:50,785
Right there. Take yourself right there,
find your ass a bunk.

455
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,995
Move it. Actin' all scared.

456
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:58,003
We ain't got no wallflowers in Camp 8.

457
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,790
Don't y'all worry none.

458
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,670
Ain't nobody gonna mess with ya tonight.

459
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:07,763
That'd take all the fun out the courtship.

460
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:09,931
You hear me, boy?

461
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,346
I didn't see nothing special the first time
Ray and Claude walked into the cage.

462
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:19,722
To me, they were just a couple of fools
whose luck had run out.

463
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:23,102
'Course, I was wrong about that.

464
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:58,099
I don't believe this 'before Abe' shit.

465
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:02,525
I didn't go to night school to dig no ditch.

466
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:07,938
What are you doing? I wouldn't do that.

467
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:11,697
Shut up. What do you know anyway?
It's too damn hot.

468
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:16,408
- Why ain't that boy's pick swingin'?
- Why ain't that pick swingin'?

469
00:34:16,749 --> 00:34:18,742
Why ain't that pick swingin', nigger?

470
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,705
It's too hot. I'm tired, boss.

471
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:25,168
He said he's too hot, boss. He's tired.

472
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:28,250
Too hot? He's tired?

473
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:32,637
You tell that lazy jigaboo
the state of Mississippi...

474
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:35,974
...ain't interested
in his meteorological assessments!

475
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:37,887
Listen up, jigaboo!

476
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:41,431
The state of Mississippi
ain't interested in your...

477
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:45,350
...your 'metacalogical' assessments!

478
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:49,272
You tell him the state of Mississippi
is only interested...

479
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,856
...in gettin' this here ditch cleared
by sundown.

480
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:56,364
State of Mississippi wants this here ditch
cleared by sundown. Got that?

481
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,575
Got it, boss.

482
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:05,411
- He don't sound like he from around here.
- He from New York City, boss.

483
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,250
That one there too.

484
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:10,046
They'll find we do things different here.

485
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:12,219
Yeah, we noticed.

486
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,394
Don't smart me, boy.
Just shut your mouth and do your work.

487
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,898
Looks like we got a couple of live ones.

488
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:31,937
- How long these boys in for?
- The judge gave 'em the long ride, boss.

489
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,528
Life, huh?

490
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,372
They step out of line again,
we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.

491
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:44,243
Get them picks a-swinging!
You heard me, New York Cities.

492
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,295
You don't want me to come down there.

493
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:51,593
I ain't nice like Boss.
I'll slap the black off your ass.

494
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:53,589
Get to work!

495
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:02,097
Either one of you new fellas
know how to read?

496
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:03,849
I know how to read. Why?

497
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,229
I've been carrying this letter
for four months.

498
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:08,310
You mean none of y'all can read?

499
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:11,902
Last fella that could read
made parole around Christmas.

500
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:15,315
I don't even know who this come from.

501
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:17,452
Give me this.

502
00:36:18,246 --> 00:36:19,740
You can't read?

503
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:23,823
Almost 60 years old,
motherfucker can't read.

504
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:27,582
It's from your mama's neighbor,
Mrs. Tadwell.

505
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:28,786
You know who?

506
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,918
She thought you ought to know
your second cousin, Bo, died.

507
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,636
Bo died. And your cousin,
Sally, on your daddy's side, she died.

508
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:40,641
- And apparently your sister died too.
- Jenny?

509
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:43,468
No, it say Marleen here. Marleen died.

510
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:46,101
Oh, no. Jenny died too.

511
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:48,231
Jenny and Marleen both dead.

512
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:53,063
It goes on for a while about how the crop
didn't come in on account of the frost.

513
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,824
She ends saying there was a big tornado...

514
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,580
...in which your mama and daddy
were both killed.

515
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,617
Don't worry,
'cause she gonna take care of the dog.

516
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:06,911
That is, if he gets over the worms.
Dog had worms.

517
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:11,503
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah, you know, anytime I can help out.

518
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:15,880
Anybody else got something
they want read?

519
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,048
Can't blame y'all.

520
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:25,720
- How ya doin'?
- I'm fine, thanks.

521
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,974
Good. First time in?

522
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,348
Nah, not at all.

523
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:34,279
I've been in and out of prison, mostly in.

524
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:38,451
So you won't have no problem adjusting?

525
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,366
Shouldn't have a problem, no.

526
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:43,453
If you need anything...

527
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:46,697
...of any kind, give me a holler.

528
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:49,951
My name's Jangle Leg.

529
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:54,205
- I appreciate it. Jangle Leg?
- Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg.

530
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,334
- I'm Claude.
- Claude.

531
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:00,681
Your hand nice and supple, like a lady.

532
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:07,680
Jangle Leg! What the hell I tell you
about pitchin' woo on the job, boy?

533
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:12,849
Sorry, Cap'n.

534
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:16,941
Story time is over.
All you sissies get back to work right now.

535
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,571
- He made a pass at me.
- Yeah, I see.

536
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:30,627
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?

537
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:33,204
You're gonna find out before me.

538
00:38:40,346 --> 00:38:42,920
- Eyes front, mister.
- Everybody doing that.

539
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,855
I'm hungry.

540
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:08,871
- See how you get that off?
- Eat and stop aggravating people.

541
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,785
I ain't aggravating nobody.

542
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:14,127
You got nerve, scraping toast and shit,
making excess noise.

543
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:17,665
- You're making a lotta noise there.
- The spoon, it's filthy.

544
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:21,171
- Filthy, ain't it?
- Fuck that spoon and just eat.

545
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:24,799
- I'm Ray Gibson, this is Claude Banks.
- Willie Long.

546
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:30,054
- You seem sensible. Why you in here?
- It's a long story.

547
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:32,720
At 13, he killed a son of a bitch
with a claw hammer.

548
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:34,891
- So they say.
- A lot of people say it.

549
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:38,519
- Wait, you been in here since you were 13?
- That's right.

550
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:40,856
How about you? How long you been here?

551
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:44,317
- He chopped his sister with an axe.
- She was my half-sister...

552
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,577
...so I cut her ass in half,
but I didn't poison my ma and pa.

553
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:50,415
- Now tell that. Tell that.
- They deserved it, Radio.

554
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,703
What you talkin' about?
You skinned your landlady alive...

555
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:55,953
...and made a jacket out of her.

556
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:58,289
Well, at least he didn't kill Santa Claus.

557
00:39:58,382 --> 00:40:00,292
Santa? Which one of you killed him?

558
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:04,050
It wasn't Santa Claus. He was just
wearing the suit and ringing a bell.

559
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:06,095
- He had presents.
- I ain't get nothing.

560
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:09,468
You killed a Salvation man,
the dude on the street with the bell?

561
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:11,387
- Something like that.
- He did.

562
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:12,854
Nobody tried to escape?

563
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:16,723
- They never get too far.
- Cookie got to Greenville a few years ago.

564
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:20,104
Take a mighty cagey country boy
to navigate the woods.

565
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:22,105
Gotta know what you're doin'.

566
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:24,573
What'd y'all do?

567
00:40:27,078 --> 00:40:29,071
What the fuck did y'all do?

568
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:34,075
- We went on...
- The most violent...

569
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:35,663
...a violent killing spree.

570
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:38,327
All around the country
we've been killing people.

571
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:41,293
All month. If y'all was out
and reading the papers...

572
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:43,709
Ain't heard about it? Claude and Ray?

573
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,003
Sometimes you got to do certain shit...

574
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:51,262
- He'd cut your throat.
- I go where I need to go to get it done.

575
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,520
If you push my button,
there's no telling what I may do...

576
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:56,764
...stab you, choke you, bite you.

577
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:00,108
I'd do whatever it takes to make
a motherfucker stop existing.

578
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:02,234
I could stab a nigger right now.

579
00:41:02,322 --> 00:41:05,026
I beat a motherfucker to death.
Don't fuck with us.

580
00:41:05,116 --> 00:41:07,572
You don't really wanna fuck with us.

581
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:10,034
Press the wrong button, nigger pop.

582
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:12,992
Hey, girl. You gonna eat your corn bread?

583
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:17,080
- Oh, trouble.
- Don't say nothin' to him.

584
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:21,083
You talkin' to me?

585
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,505
Yeah, I think he's talking to you.

586
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,881
No, not at all. I want you to have it.

587
00:41:27,972 --> 00:41:30,048
Willie, you mind passing this down to...

588
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:32,846
No. Don't pass your corn bread to him.

589
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:35,552
- That's your corn bread.
- I'm a grown man.

590
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:39,015
I'm not gonna eat this.
If he wants the corn bread, have it.

591
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:42,312
If he wants corn bread,
let him up to the front and get his own.

592
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:44,562
That's your corn bread. Fuck him.

593
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:47,028
He gonna eat his corn bread. Fuck you.

594
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:50,112
I don't need you to take up for me.

595
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:52,821
I'm a grown man. I can handle it.

596
00:41:52,914 --> 00:41:55,950
If you let him have it,
you'll be ironing his drawers.

597
00:41:56,042 --> 00:42:00,040
- I ain't gonna be ironing.
- Maybe I ought to eat your corn bread.

598
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:03,963
Motherfucker, you can't have
my corn bread, that's for damn sure.

599
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,623
If you try to take it,
part two of my killin' spree...

600
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,795
...gonna begin up here on your ass now.

601
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:11,379
If you're thinkin' about my corn bread,
forget it.

602
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:13,799
- That's for sure. Fuck that.
- Cool it.

603
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:16,303
I'm from New York City, goddamn it.

604
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,187
Nobody take no corn bread from me.

605
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:21,606
That go for you and any other
of you motherfucking farmers.

606
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:25,772
You fuck around with me, there's gonna
be consequences and repercussions.

607
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:28,605
Get up!

608
00:42:44,423 --> 00:42:48,208
Come on! Show that son of a bitch
how y'all do it in Harlem.

609
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:11,366
Come on, New York.

610
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:25,922
I appreciate you taking the trouble
over my corn bread.

611
00:43:26,007 --> 00:43:28,498
You don't get a lot of compliments here.

612
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:39,722
Get up!

613
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:44,816
I think you made your point,
whatever that is.

614
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:48,649
Now's a good time to throw in the towel,
you know what I'm sayin'?

615
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:52,696
Not over no corn bread.

616
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:03,458
Goldmouth, I know a bitch
named Della hit harder than you.

617
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:13,386
That's it.
The man's taken enough of a beating.

618
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:17,633
Goldmouth, pick him up
and carry him on inside.

619
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,524
He ain't gettin' my corn bread.

620
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:41,451
You were scared, huh? Don't be scared.

621
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:14,861
Papa!

622
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,444
That's my boy.

623
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:24,619
Request permission
to go to the tonk, boss.

624
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,914
Conjugal visits
are for married prisoners only...

625
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:30,329
...and I don't see no weddin' ring.

626
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:33,124
Can't you make an exception?

627
00:45:33,801 --> 00:45:38,463
I could issue a temporary marriage license,
for a nominal fee.

628
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:45,601
- Here you go.
- Sure is pretty.

629
00:45:47,732 --> 00:45:49,855
I now pronounce you man and wife.

630
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:51,900
You go have a good time.

631
00:45:55,156 --> 00:45:57,445
Claude Banks going to the tonk!

632
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:03,864
- Come on, now.
- Five cents.

633
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:09,000
Hey, New York.
You ever been to that Cotton Club?

634
00:46:09,086 --> 00:46:11,542
The Cotton Club in Manhattan?
Many times.

635
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:14,585
I damn near lived in the Cotton Club.
It's all right.

636
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:16,882
They ain't got nothin'
on the Boom-Boom Room.

637
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,006
You ever go to New York,
go to Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

638
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:22,140
What is the Boom-Boom Room?

639
00:46:22,225 --> 00:46:25,558
That's my spot.
Most happening space in Manhattan.

640
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,430
So you got your own nightclub?

641
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:31,642
It's kinda in the development stages,
but I'm working on it.

642
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:33,145
So it don't exist?

643
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:35,145
It exists in my mind.

644
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:38,532
It start your brain first.

645
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,107
As a man think it, so shall he get.

646
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:44,405
Some shit like that.
You know, you read the Bible.

647
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:48,623
Did you go see my cousin Melvin
like I asked you to in my letter?

648
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,995
Of course, I did.
He said he'd file an appeal right away.

649
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:56,038
Melvin wanted to know...

650
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:58,422
...if he should file an appeal for your friend.

651
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:00,136
Ray Gibson? No.

652
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:05,132
No, Daisy.

653
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:10,723
He's the reason I'm in here.
He's got a record a mile long.

654
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:13,603
I got a better shot of gettin' outta here
on my own.

655
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:17,940
You tell Melvin to think about me.
Just concentrate on me.

656
00:47:24,662 --> 00:47:27,367
- Cookie made me a map to Greenville.
- So?

657
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:30,584
- You know what I'm sayin'.
- I know what you're sayin'.

658
00:47:30,668 --> 00:47:34,832
If you made it that far, they'd check
every train that pulls out of the station.

659
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,503
We ain't takin' the train. There's a farm
on the map and a boat on the farm.

660
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:42,511
You know about boats?
You probably don't know how to swim.

661
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:46,429
I know a boat can help sail our ass
away from here. We can do this shit.

662
00:47:46,517 --> 00:47:48,475
- Why are you always saying 'we'?
- What?

663
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:51,846
There's no 'we.'
There's a me, and there's a you.

664
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:55,439
- Why're you talkin' so loud?
- There ain't no 'we' between us.

665
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:08,151
Hey, Ray!

666
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:12,163
Yeah?

667
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:15,743
What's the name
of that nightclub of yours again?

668
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:18,839
- You talkin' about the Boom-Boom Room?
- Yeah.

669
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:23,670
That's it. I'd sure like to see that place
when you get it all up and runnin'.

670
00:48:23,888 --> 00:48:27,304
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too. I'd like to see that room too.

671
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:31,812
You should've been there last night.
You'd have had big fun.

672
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,139
What you talkin' about, 'last night'?

673
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:36,438
Just like I said, last night.

674
00:48:36,692 --> 00:48:39,231
Satchmo was there
and nearly blew the roof off.

675
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,277
- Ray, who that?
- Satchmo.

676
00:48:41,864 --> 00:48:43,489
You mean Louis Armstrong?

677
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:45,448
I call him Satchmo. I know him.

678
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:48,951
I call him Satchmo,
and he come by whenever he in town.

679
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:52,372
Ain't nobody wanting to hear that bullshit.

680
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:55,657
Shut the fuck up.

681
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,791
Always saying things at the wrong time.

682
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:01,170
Go to sleep. Let us have our fun.

683
00:49:01,342 --> 00:49:03,584
Finish telling us about Satchmo.

684
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:05,386
Go ahead, tell me more.

685
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:10,718
As I was sayin',
last night y'all should've come by.

686
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:13,350
You'll never guess who'll be there tonight.

687
00:49:13,438 --> 00:49:15,347
Who gonna be there?

688
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:17,479
- Who that, Ray?
- Just guess.

689
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:22,653
'I got a man that's more than 8-foot tall

690
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:25,777
'Four foot shoulders and that ain't all

691
00:49:25,866 --> 00:49:28,025
'He's a king-sized papa

692
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:30,701
'He's my king-sized papa'

693
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,325
Sing, girl!

694
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,662
'I take the door off the hinges
When my baby comes to call'

695
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:40,168
Catch any cab headin' uptown...

696
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:43,376
...all the drivers know
about Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

697
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:45,045
Ray! Where am I?

698
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,882
Goldmouth,
somebody's gotta watch the door.

699
00:49:52,143 --> 00:49:55,060
Now I could get used to this. Ladies.

700
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:02,148
Ray, this steak tastes like butter.

701
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:04,189
Made it just for you, Cookie.

702
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,731
- You got some steak sauce?
- Boy, get us some Worcestershire sauce.

703
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:10,909
And clean off that damn table,
or I'll whup your ass.

704
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:16,500
Is something wrong with your ears?
Move it!

705
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:19,534
Ray! I know your club got gambling.

706
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:22,501
Poker.
Wouldn't be a club without some dice.

707
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:27,715
Lucky seven! My man! Let it ride!

708
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:30,421
All right, Poker, lettin' it ride.

709
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:37,384
- Raid! Don't move!
- Shit! Party's over.

710
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,852
- Son of a bitch!
- Goddamn! Party over.

711
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:43,608
Get the back door!
Put all the women in my car! Gibson!

712
00:50:45,196 --> 00:50:47,568
You about ready to spend
the night in the hole.

713
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:50,741
Now shut up and go to sleep.
You got that?

714
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:54,996
That goes for the rest of you girls too.

715
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:59,245
Now I don't wanna hear another peep
about no fuckin' Boom-Boom Room.

716
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:02,916
Sorry, Cap'n.

717
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,496
Shut your mouth and your fat ass.

718
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:10,127
Don't be playing with yourselves.
You gotta work in the morning.

719
00:51:14,642 --> 00:51:15,970
Mail call!

720
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:19,973
That's mine.

721
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:22,893
You know I hate this part,
it's too hard for me.

722
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:25,901
I'm gonna get back
to that game in a little while.

723
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:38,866
- Right here.
- Melvin Banks, Esquire, Attorney at Law.

724
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:42,327
- What's going on?
- This don't concern you. Excuse me.

725
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:44,504
Yeah, obviously not.

726
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:50,585
Slow up. You see me countin'.

727
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:52,256
Go on. Come on.

728
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:56,009
This here is Biscuit.
This is New York City One...

729
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:58,387
Let's move on!

730
00:51:58,478 --> 00:52:00,766
Only 15 hours of daylight left.

731
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,646
Got all my rocks here, boss.

732
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:09,398
Sure is hot. Think it's gonna rain later?

733
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:13,782
- What you want?
- What makes you think I want something?

734
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:17,451
My dad told me when someone talks about
the weather, watch your wallet.

735
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:19,946
Your daddy must have been a wise man.

736
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:23,163
Cut the shit and tell me what you want.

737
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:25,377
You still got that map?

738
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:27,628
Yeah, I still got it. Why?

739
00:52:29,383 --> 00:52:32,135
If you thinkin' about bookin' it, I want in.

740
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:34,296
I think we can make it.

741
00:52:34,972 --> 00:52:37,677
Didn't you tell me there was no 'we'?

742
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:42,393
Now it's 'we' again? What happened?
Bad news in that letter?

743
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:47,061
My cousin Melvin is a lawyer
and he filed an appeal on my behalf.

744
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:49,773
On your behalf? What happened to 'we'?

745
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:52,104
- The appeal was denied.
- I'm glad.

746
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:55,483
Daisy fell for Melvin.
They're engaged to be married.

747
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:57,984
- Can you believe that?
- That's hard to believe.

748
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,993
He a big, successful New York lawyer
and you here with a bright future in cotton.

749
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:05,748
Let me figure it out for you.
Eenie, meenie, miney, Melvin!

750
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,170
Come on, Ray. I'm serious.

751
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:12,715
Don't shut me out.
You, me, the map... we can go places.

752
00:53:12,802 --> 00:53:15,258
The whole time we been here...

753
00:53:15,346 --> 00:53:17,255
...you just blame this shit on me.

754
00:53:17,348 --> 00:53:19,555
And you just think about yourself.

755
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:22,394
- Your little scheme. Was I part of that?
- No.

756
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:25,349
You'll be honest now
'cause you wanna be friends.

757
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:28,934
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. My-Shit-Don't-Stink Banks.

758
00:53:29,027 --> 00:53:32,645
You got to learn a whole lot more
about friendship.

759
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,939
Boss, he ain't workin'!

760
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:40,989
- Does this mean I'm in?
- Nah, you'd probably slow me down.

761
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,750
You'll be worrying about
your silverware being clean.

762
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,324
You one of them soft motherfuckers.

763
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:49,254
- What you say?
- I said you soft. So what?

764
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:52,834
- What you gonna do?
- No man calls me soft. I hate that!

765
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:55,796
I'm a man, and I called you soft.

766
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:59,007
I don't like you swellin' all up.

767
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:01,257
Why you takin' in all this air for?

768
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,427
What's on your mind?

769
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,189
You gonna put your chin up?
That mean something to me?

770
00:54:06,272 --> 00:54:08,265
'Cause I said 'soft'? So what?

771
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:10,979
I spell it. S-O-F-capital-T!

772
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:13,987
Soft! What you gonna do?

773
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:21,368
You must be crazy. I'll kill you.

774
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:24,455
- Oh, this is good.
- Break it up!

775
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:36,965
I'm gettin' ready to shoot somebody here!

776
00:54:37,095 --> 00:54:39,052
I'm gonna shoot a motherfucker today.

777
00:54:39,138 --> 00:54:41,380
Ain't gonna forget this,
you New York Cities.

778
00:54:41,474 --> 00:54:44,309
- He started it.
- Don't go to sleep, nigger.

779
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:48,477
I don't mess with nobody. You know that.

780
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:56,444
Get back to work.

781
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:59,818
This ain't over, nigger.
I don't give a fuck what he say.

782
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:01,024
I'll shoot your ass.

783
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:02,827
Don't go to sleep!

784
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:05,614
We'll see who go to sleep.

785
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,844
Shit. Come on! Two running!

786
00:55:30,648 --> 00:55:34,397
I know these trees all look alike,
but this one is awful familiar.

787
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:36,229
Let me see that map.

788
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:42,276
You call this a map?

789
00:55:42,535 --> 00:55:45,322
What was Cookie smokin'
when he drew this?

790
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:48,165
Cookie didn't draw it. I drew it up.

791
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:52,459
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You don't know where we're goin'.

792
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:55,332
I drew it 'cause you wouldn't come
unless I had a map.

793
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:57,581
Now come on!

794
00:55:57,925 --> 00:56:00,417
Wait up. Wait up!

795
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:37,585
Take the dogs around the house!

796
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:41,211
Y'all bring the dogs with me! Come on!

797
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:46,007
Come on!

798
00:57:03,866 --> 00:57:05,740
Here they are, Superintendent.

799
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:08,662
Tracked 'em all the way
to the Tallahatchie.

800
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,036
That's quite a ways, isn't it?

801
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,698
I'm glad you New York boys
got to see some of...

802
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:16,200
...our beautiful countryside
while we got you here.

803
00:57:16,295 --> 00:57:17,540
Mae Rose!

804
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:22,582
What do you think we oughta do
to teach 'em a lesson?

805
00:57:24,762 --> 00:57:25,960
A night in the hole?

806
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:28,926
A night in the hole. Better make it a week.

807
00:57:51,831 --> 00:57:53,740
No, don't move so fast.

808
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:03,383
Fuck y'all!

809
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,254
- Hey, Claude!
- What?

810
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:08,506
You got a toilet in yours?

811
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:11,136
That was the first time
that Ray and Claude ran...

812
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:12,257
...but it sure wasn't the last.

813
00:58:12,894 --> 00:58:15,811
Japan suffers its
most crushing defeat of the war.

814
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:20,522
Years passed, and the world went to war
for a second time.

815
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:25,695
While they was fightin' for freedom
on the outside...

816
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:28,901
...we were dreamin' about it on the inside.

817
00:58:30,328 --> 00:58:32,451
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

818
00:58:34,165 --> 00:58:36,738
Whatever you done, I'm not impressed.

819
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,792
I've seen it all before.

820
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,206
You probably noticed that we got
no fences at Camp 8.

821
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:45,833
We don't need fences
'cause we got a gun line.

822
00:58:46,177 --> 00:58:47,719
It runs from...

823
00:58:52,934 --> 00:58:55,721
What the hell you doin'?

824
00:58:56,604 --> 00:59:00,602
The boy can't talk.
Somethin' wrong with his head.

825
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:04,435
Just can't get right, boss.

826
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:07,857
'Can't get right.'

827
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:11,399
All right. We'll see how long he lasts.

828
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:14,199
- Where was I?
- We don't need no fences at Camp 8.

829
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:17,823
- What?
- We don't need no fences here at Camp 8.

830
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:20,619
- The gun line, boss.
- Yes.

831
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:24,121
You prisoners are now inside the gun line.

832
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:27,216
When Dillard found out
that Claude was a baseball man...

833
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:29,294
...he put him in charge of the team.

834
00:59:29,387 --> 00:59:32,756
That way, when we lost,
he could blame it on somebody else.

835
00:59:36,894 --> 00:59:38,721
No, that's not it.

836
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:46,310
Try to teach 'em the finer points
of the game...

837
00:59:46,612 --> 00:59:49,150
...share my wisdom, but do they listen?

838
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,775
They damn sure don't learn.

839
00:59:52,368 --> 00:59:54,575
You're dealin' with a total lack of talent.

840
00:59:54,662 --> 00:59:56,619
Ain't nobody got no talent.

841
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:59,404
Every year,
Camp 12 wins the championship.

842
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,118
Every year they get to roast a victory pig.
This year, I want that pig.

843
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,786
Jangle Leg, put it right to him.

844
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:11,419
That's what I'm talking about!

845
01:00:11,637 --> 01:00:14,093
Who wants to hit next?

846
01:00:15,016 --> 01:00:17,589
- Find the card.
- Don't nobody wanna hit?

847
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:19,518
Do you wanna hit?

848
01:00:20,021 --> 01:00:22,559
Let Can't Get Right have a swing.

849
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:26,317
- Him?
- He can't be worse than the rest.

850
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:28,817
Let the boy have a swing.

851
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:34,201
Let's see what you can do.

852
01:00:34,285 --> 01:00:38,532
Put that bat in your hand,
hold it tight and take a nice swing.

853
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:43,039
Jangle Leg, a little easy on him.

854
01:00:43,795 --> 01:00:47,294
- He's new, so we don't wanna...
- Don't try to hurt the man.

855
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:53,591
Even swing, Can't Get Right.

856
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:56,253
Don't be scared of the ball.

857
01:01:05,107 --> 01:01:06,685
That wasn't bad.

858
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:08,899
Put that on it.

859
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:12,320
That might have been
one of those retard mistakes.

860
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:26,078
Give him that tricky one.

861
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:43,516
Damn.

862
01:01:45,064 --> 01:01:46,689
Daddy!

863
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:50,560
- That's just like fresh water.
- Hey, my little girl.

864
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:53,981
- Look like little Mae Rose done growed up.
- And out.

865
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,198
That girl got gams.

866
01:01:57,243 --> 01:01:58,868
How was the honeymoon?

867
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:01,118
- You gonna stay for supper?
- 'Fraid not.

868
01:02:01,205 --> 01:02:03,328
I'm shippin' out this afternoon.

869
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:06,460
You lookin' a little bit too hard.

870
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:10,546
Duh, my ass. You better just...

871
01:02:11,591 --> 01:02:13,630
Turn around to the left.
We have a problem.

872
01:02:13,718 --> 01:02:15,794
It's all right to glance occasionally...

873
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:18,804
...but you look like you wanted to go
and start fucking.

874
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:22,887
Turn around. I'm keepin' you out
of some trouble. Paint the fence.

875
01:02:22,977 --> 01:02:24,768
Banks! Get over here.

876
01:02:25,438 --> 01:02:27,680
I'll be right back.

877
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:31,813
Stan Blocker,
a scout for the nigger leagues.

878
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:34,228
Negro leagues, actually.

879
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:37,069
Pittsburgh Crawfords. Ever hear of us?

880
01:02:37,158 --> 01:02:39,614
We get the games on the radio sometimes.

881
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:41,944
We played in Jackson yesterday...

882
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:44,576
...heard you got a boy who can hit the ball.

883
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,702
You must mean Can't Get Right.

884
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:50,201
That's him over there.

885
01:02:50,296 --> 01:02:53,083
'Can't Get Right'? That's the kid's name?

886
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:54,414
Yep.

887
01:02:55,593 --> 01:02:57,253
Can I talk to him?

888
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:01,801
You could try, but you won't get too far.
Why're you interested?

889
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,596
Crawfords are always looking
for new talent.

890
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:09,681
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but this is a prison.

891
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:11,939
There are ways around that.

892
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:13,896
Right, Sergeant?

893
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:15,737
One never knows.

894
01:03:18,366 --> 01:03:20,074
Nice looking squad.

895
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,917
- Look at the way she glows.
- She is pretty, isn't she?

896
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:31,378
Thanks, Mom.

897
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:35,422
And we're gonna have a baby.
Oh my goodness.

898
01:03:43,683 --> 01:03:47,134
Can't Get Right, no, you can't do that.

899
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,723
Let's keep what mind you got focused.

900
01:03:52,817 --> 01:03:57,111
If you hit that ball,
you might be our ticket off this farm.

901
01:03:57,196 --> 01:03:59,153
Come on. Think victory.

902
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:03,651
The ball! Keep your eye on the ball.

903
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:06,995
Get up underneath that motherfucker.
Do your thing!

904
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:10,035
Put some of that dumb strength on it!

905
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,337
We gonna knock that shit
right off the team!

906
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:21,049
That's what I'm talkin' about!

907
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:23,636
Don't stand there! Run!

908
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,133
Run! Go! Just haul ass!

909
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:28,434
Run, nigger, run!

910
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:32,937
Oh, that's our ticket off this farm.

911
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:44,659
You mark my words.

912
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:47,615
In five years, there'll be
a colored man in the majors.

913
01:04:47,705 --> 01:04:50,706
I don't think the world changed that much.

914
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,957
Maybe not yet, but it will.

915
01:04:53,044 --> 01:04:54,835
I'll be out of a job.

916
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:57,122
That's some tasty hootch.

917
01:04:57,215 --> 01:05:01,212
It's amazing what Ray can do
with potato skins and some molasses.

918
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:05,427
What you think about our boy?
He got something?

919
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:07,673
He could be the next Josh Gibson.

920
01:05:09,477 --> 01:05:12,727
It's getting late, boys.
We got a game in Memphis tomorrow.

921
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:15,020
What about us?
Don't forget to mention us.

922
01:05:15,107 --> 01:05:18,524
'Cause we like his handlers.
We take care of everything for him.

923
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:20,319
I'll put in a good word for you.

924
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:22,278
He can't function without us.

925
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:24,488
- You've done a good job with him.
- Thanks.

926
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:27,779
- We're hands-on with him.
- Okay. All right.

927
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,780
- Take care.
- Have a nice day.

928
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:32,621
- Walked off with my drink.
- Sure did.

929
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:36,623
I ain't gonna say nothin'. Have a good day!

930
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:40,629
- Y'all come on over here!
- Y'all got something to drink?

931
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:43,124
Look what we got! Some of your stuff.

932
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:46,054
Can't Get Right, this one's for you, baby!

933
01:05:56,482 --> 01:05:58,142
What in the world?

934
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:01,816
What?

935
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:09,654
- Is Mae Rose all right?
- She's doin' just fine.

936
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:12,037
What about the baby?

937
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,285
He's a big'un.

938
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:18,575
'He'? It's a boy? Honey, it's a boy!

939
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:21,961
Yeah, buddy!

940
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:24,375
Let me see that boy! Where is that boy?

941
01:06:24,469 --> 01:06:26,342
Show me that grandboy!

942
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:32,513
I want every man in this camp
on the line right now!

943
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:35,302
Right now! I mean right now!

944
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:37,930
Bring 'em out here! Let me see 'em!

945
01:07:07,887 --> 01:07:10,592
Hope not. It was somebody in this camp.

946
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:14,176
I can feel it in my bones.

947
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,482
Daddy, give me my baby back.

948
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:32,117
What you laughin' at? You laughin' at me?

949
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:36,205
You know who the daddy
of that chocolated baby is?

950
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:38,000
You do?

951
01:07:38,418 --> 01:07:40,457
Well, who is it? Speak up!

952
01:07:41,587 --> 01:07:43,295
It's my baby, boss.

953
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:46,123
He's lying. I'm the father of that baby.

954
01:07:46,217 --> 01:07:48,340
Boss, I'm that baby's daddy.

955
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,129
Any fool can see that baby belongs to me.

956
01:07:52,223 --> 01:07:55,343
I wanna differ.
That little rascal belong to me.

957
01:07:55,893 --> 01:07:58,563
Proud to say, boss, I'm that baby's daddy.

958
01:07:59,063 --> 01:08:02,432
- I be the pa, boss.
- I'm the pa of that there young'un.

959
01:08:03,317 --> 01:08:04,693
I the pappy.

960
01:08:32,888 --> 01:08:34,632
That was the last we ever saw...

961
01:08:34,724 --> 01:08:37,595
...of Superintendent Abernathy
and little Mae Rose.

962
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:41,435
To celebrate his departure...

963
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:44,602
...Camp 8 threw ourselves a little party.

964
01:08:45,693 --> 01:08:47,567
Ray provided the moonshine...

965
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:50,608
...and Claude managed to scare up
some girls.

966
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:54,442
It wasn't quite the Boom-Boom Room,
but it was close enough.

967
01:08:59,374 --> 01:09:00,832
Come on, now.

968
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:04,580
She don't mean nothin' to him.
Don't pay that no mind.

969
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:07,078
To hell with him. It ain't that.

970
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:11,257
What's your problem,
sittin' around lookin' all sad and shit?

971
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:14,345
It's almost all right in here today.

972
01:09:19,685 --> 01:09:21,096
What's this?

973
01:09:26,484 --> 01:09:28,726
A release form.
You gettin' out this month.

974
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,769
- What you sittin' around lookin' all sad for?
- What am I gonna do out there?

975
01:09:32,865 --> 01:09:35,238
I can't go home to my mama like this.

976
01:09:35,326 --> 01:09:39,371
You are crazy. Your mama gonna be happy
when you get home.

977
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,496
But not like this, Ray.

978
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:45,784
Hey, look. The world done changed
a lot. It's 1945, boy.

979
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:48,796
Not for me, it ain't.

980
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:55,083
You can't stay here. That's for damn sure.

981
01:09:55,346 --> 01:09:59,510
Anybody else in the place would give
his right arm... I know I would.

982
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:07,563
Shit. Fuckin' release papers,
sittin' over here lookin' sad.

983
01:10:08,484 --> 01:10:10,393
I won't sit here with you lookin' sad.

984
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:13,938
You got the best news of the day
and you're sitting here looking sad.

985
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:16,987
You cheer up. You're goin' home.

986
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:20,160
Hey, man, that's good news.
Come on. You're goin' home.

987
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:22,073
You gonna smile? There you go.

988
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:24,371
I'll see you in a minute.

989
01:10:48,358 --> 01:10:50,350
Where you goin', Biscuit?

990
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:55,812
Where you goin'? Don't do that!

991
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:00,234
Hold it right there!

992
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,287
Man over the line!

993
01:12:05,893 --> 01:12:07,387
I got Chicago!

994
01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:11,054
- Goldmouth, I got Chicago!
- Yeah?

995
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:13,268
Come on, fellas.

996
01:12:14,027 --> 01:12:16,565
- Where you goin'?
- Why you all dressed up?

997
01:12:21,325 --> 01:12:22,736
What's this?

998
01:12:23,327 --> 01:12:25,201
What the fuck is going on?

999
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,954
Blocker! What's goin' on here?

1000
01:12:31,377 --> 01:12:33,950
The kid's gettin' out. I got him a pardon.

1001
01:12:34,255 --> 01:12:37,125
What about me and Ray?
Our names ain't on the pardon.

1002
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:40,052
- You said you put in a good word for us.
- I did.

1003
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:43,889
I mentioned you. I mentioned both of you.

1004
01:12:43,973 --> 01:12:46,808
But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap.

1005
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:50,270
That kid can hit. What can you guys do?

1006
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:54,056
We're the ones who worked with him...

1007
01:12:54,317 --> 01:12:56,938
...night and day.
- Forget it, man. Let it go.

1008
01:12:57,028 --> 01:12:59,780
I'm not gonna let it go.

1009
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:03,447
The man said he was gonna put in
a good word. Explain yourself.

1010
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:06,451
But the kid's gettin' out,
that's what you wanted.

1011
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:18,791
Yeah. Of course.

1012
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:27,554
You show them Crawfords
how to play ball.

1013
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:29,599
Make 'em throw you strikes.

1014
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:35,939
Go. You're a free man.

1015
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:43,692
It's all right.

1016
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:13,803
- Come on, son.
- We love you, boy.

1017
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:17,726
Hit that ball, boy.

1018
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:21,152
You hit one out the park for me.

1019
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:25,032
Play hard, Can't Get Right!

1020
01:14:30,371 --> 01:14:32,245
We'll catch you on the radio!

1021
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:34,324
All right. So that's that.

1022
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:37,912
A new boy told me
they're farming that land by the swamp.

1023
01:14:38,004 --> 01:14:40,874
- He saw a crop duster flyin'...
- I'm not in the mood.

1024
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:43,717
It's behind the barn.
It can't be that hard to fly it.

1025
01:14:43,802 --> 01:14:46,209
- Lots of people do it.
- They're called pilots.

1026
01:14:46,304 --> 01:14:49,554
I'm not in the mood
for your fucked-up plans.

1027
01:14:49,641 --> 01:14:51,763
I don't hear you comin' up with no plan!

1028
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:54,852
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh
right now.

1029
01:14:55,605 --> 01:14:59,104
Can't Get Right just got a pardon
signed by the governor, thanks to us.

1030
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:01,398
But we can't do nothin' for ourselves.

1031
01:15:01,486 --> 01:15:04,190
Don't you feel a little frustrated right now?

1032
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:08,190
- Crop duster.
- I'm not gettin' in no airplane with you.

1033
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:16,538
I'm finally wrapping my mind
around this whole concept.

1034
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:20,742
- What concept is that?
- They threw us in this shithole for life.

1035
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:23,003
Don't you get it? We gonna die here.

1036
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:26,625
We might as well head to the cemetery,
pick a plot and start digging.

1037
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,218
My daddy died in a place like this
because of what you're sayin'.

1038
01:15:30,306 --> 01:15:33,342
He gave up hope and hung hisself.
I ain't goin' out like that!

1039
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:37,597
Maybe you're foolin' yourself.
Maybe you just a chip off the old block.

1040
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:42,516
Take that back,
or we ain't friends no more.

1041
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,397
News flash. We ain't never been friends.

1042
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,199
We just been stuck together for 12 years.

1043
01:15:48,283 --> 01:15:51,865
It's been nothin' but pure hell
since the moment I ran into you.

1044
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:54,616
Every time I look at you,
I get sick to my stomach...

1045
01:15:54,706 --> 01:15:57,955
...thinkin' what my life could've been
if I never bumped into you.

1046
01:15:58,042 --> 01:16:00,450
Slow down, you might say
something you'll regret.

1047
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:05,006
- You better quiet down, nigger.
- Only thing I regret is the day I met you.

1048
01:16:07,552 --> 01:16:09,176
- That's the way it is?
- Yeah, that's the way it is.

1049
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:12,216
I ain't got nothin' else to say to your ass.

1050
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,635
Thank you!

1051
01:16:15,643 --> 01:16:19,094
Now if you ask me,
when Can't Get Right left Camp 8...

1052
01:16:19,272 --> 01:16:21,597
...a piece of Claude left with him.

1053
01:16:22,901 --> 01:16:25,391
And with Ray and Claude not talkin'...

1054
01:16:25,528 --> 01:16:28,695
...the place felt a little harder,
a little colder.

1055
01:16:56,809 --> 01:16:58,433
I have a dream.

1056
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,098
I'm the greatest! I'm the king of the world.

1057
01:17:17,455 --> 01:17:19,531
We got to fight for ourselves.

1058
01:17:32,428 --> 01:17:34,753
I'll see y'all in New York City!

1059
01:17:35,306 --> 01:17:36,848
Oh, shit!

1060
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:30,943
Round about 1972...

1061
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:34,022
...I got transferred to the infirmary...

1062
01:18:34,741 --> 01:18:37,314
...and those two fools were still at it.

1063
01:18:41,914 --> 01:18:44,286
But no matter how tough a man is...

1064
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:46,790
...he spends enough time on this farm...

1065
01:18:46,877 --> 01:18:49,084
...he'll find his breaking point.

1066
01:18:49,672 --> 01:18:52,377
It could be triggered by any little thing.

1067
01:18:52,509 --> 01:18:54,797
A face. A voice. Even a smell.

1068
01:19:06,147 --> 01:19:07,724
White-only pies.

1069
01:19:12,278 --> 01:19:13,938
Man over the line!

1070
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:30,872
That boy went crazy.

1071
01:19:36,094 --> 01:19:37,671
You comfortable?

1072
01:19:38,429 --> 01:19:41,181
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers.

1073
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:46,594
That's very amusin'.
We'll see how them slippers feel...

1074
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:48,888
...after about 24 hours.

1075
01:19:52,193 --> 01:19:53,936
I need a volunteer!

1076
01:19:55,196 --> 01:19:56,821
Gibson, stand up.

1077
01:19:57,991 --> 01:20:00,316
I'll make you trusty right now.

1078
01:20:00,451 --> 01:20:03,120
If that pie-eatin' bastard step off
them bottles...

1079
01:20:03,204 --> 01:20:05,327
...if so much as one toe hit that dirt...

1080
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:07,573
...I want you to shoot him in his ass.

1081
01:20:08,918 --> 01:20:12,252
I want you to kill him.
I want you to shoot him dead.

1082
01:20:12,714 --> 01:20:15,335
You do that, I swear to God,
you're a free man.

1083
01:20:15,425 --> 01:20:18,176
I'll walk you out the gate myself.

1084
01:20:18,803 --> 01:20:20,297
What d'ya say?

1085
01:20:24,684 --> 01:20:27,257
I got to be honest with you, boss.

1086
01:20:27,353 --> 01:20:31,398
You don't wanna give me that gun,
'cause I'd probably shoot you with it.

1087
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,816
That was the wrong answer, boy.

1088
01:20:37,447 --> 01:20:40,068
You a fool. I'd have taken that deal.

1089
01:20:41,116 --> 01:20:43,738
I beg pardon? You say something to me?

1090
01:20:43,995 --> 01:20:46,782
I'd have knocked you off,
put a bullet in your ass...

1091
01:20:46,872 --> 01:20:49,198
...and be halfway to New York right now.

1092
01:20:51,043 --> 01:20:54,626
Well, my goodness.
After all these years of blissful silence...

1093
01:20:54,881 --> 01:20:58,048
...I forgot how annoying
the sound of your voice is.

1094
01:20:58,968 --> 01:21:02,882
I hope you know
I don't owe you a damn thing.

1095
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:05,380
I ain't do nothin' for you to owe me.

1096
01:21:05,475 --> 01:21:08,262
What you got I ain't got? I did it for me.

1097
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,971
I'm a man. I ain't no motherfucking,
bootlickin' trusty.

1098
01:21:12,148 --> 01:21:14,437
You'll make me fall off, talkin' to your ass.

1099
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:17,526
It's about being poised.
Just poise yourself.

1100
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,315
Poise, my ass.

1101
01:21:24,452 --> 01:21:27,121
Sorry to hear about your mama passing.

1102
01:21:28,957 --> 01:21:31,079
Yeah, about five years ago.

1103
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,495
Thank you.

1104
01:21:33,294 --> 01:21:35,500
Since we're talkin', I thought I'd mention it.

1105
01:21:35,588 --> 01:21:39,039
We not talkin', you talkin'.
And doin' a little bit too much of it.

1106
01:21:39,133 --> 01:21:41,589
Every time you start talkin', I almost fall...

1107
01:21:41,678 --> 01:21:44,169
- Would you stop...
- Don't say nothin' else to me!

1108
01:21:44,263 --> 01:21:47,632
- You about to make me fall.
- Hold still, don't say nothin'.

1109
01:21:51,187 --> 01:21:53,891
Oh! Damn, one of my toes in the bottle.

1110
01:21:54,232 --> 01:21:55,975
Damn it, Ray, shit.

1111
01:22:04,617 --> 01:22:07,404
What you laughin' about?
What's so funny?

1112
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:13,158
Thinkin' about you runnin' with bullets
flyin' over your head.

1113
01:22:13,251 --> 01:22:16,287
That's something to see there.
That was a sight to see.

1114
01:22:16,379 --> 01:22:18,502
Bullets weren't the problem, Ray.

1115
01:22:18,589 --> 01:22:20,381
That pie was too hot.

1116
01:22:20,716 --> 01:22:22,543
Burned my damn tongue.

1117
01:22:26,347 --> 01:22:29,182
It sure is good talkin' to you again.

1118
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:32,845
Good talkin' to you too.

1119
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,266
Come on! Let's move!

1120
01:22:36,357 --> 01:22:39,311
We got 14 acres of land to clear today!
Let's go!

1121
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,528
Gibson, Banks,
get your sorry asses over here.

1122
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:47,690
Every mornin' I wake up prayin'...

1123
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:52,238
...that the two of you
have died in their sleep.

1124
01:22:52,957 --> 01:22:55,495
And every mornin' you disappoint me.

1125
01:22:56,002 --> 01:22:57,413
Sorry, boss.

1126
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:01,749
You two got 15 minutes
to clear out your lockers.

1127
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:05,886
The both of you have been transferred
to the superintendent's mansion.

1128
01:23:06,054 --> 01:23:08,379
And I, for one, won't miss you.

1129
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:22,232
Here's your medicine, Mr. Wilkins.

1130
01:23:22,612 --> 01:23:24,735
My pills. Thank you.

1131
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:26,483
You're welcome.

1132
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,958
Oh, yard boy.

1133
01:23:38,211 --> 01:23:40,784
This myrtle could use some attention.

1134
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:44,255
Perhaps some fertilizer
would restore its exuberance.

1135
01:23:46,761 --> 01:23:48,553
Get your ass to work.

1136
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:55,049
Tell me what you think of this place.

1137
01:23:55,979 --> 01:23:59,014
It's one of these
new retirement communities...

1138
01:23:59,149 --> 01:24:01,271
...they built down on the Gulf.

1139
01:24:01,984 --> 01:24:05,603
I ought to try to enjoy myself
what few years I got left.

1140
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:09,948
Let's take a look at this.

1141
01:24:10,117 --> 01:24:13,617
Eyesight ain't what it once was.
Ooh, this is nice here.

1142
01:24:15,123 --> 01:24:18,990
'Ocean views... palm trees.'

1143
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:22,078
'Two heated swimming pools.'

1144
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:26,754
Sounds a damn sight better
than that infirmary across the way...

1145
01:24:26,843 --> 01:24:29,714
...where I'm gonna end up, I'll tell you that.

1146
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:40,015
I must apologize. That was rude of me.

1147
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:45,525
That's all right. Takes more than
some colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.

1148
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,731
You've been on the farm for quite a spell,
haven't you?

1149
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,285
Over 40 years now.
Me and Ray Gibson out there.

1150
01:24:55,204 --> 01:24:56,615
Forty years.

1151
01:24:57,748 --> 01:25:00,418
That's a long time for any crime,
even murder.

1152
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:04,377
It's a hell of a lot longer
when you're innocent.

1153
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,040
Half the men in this prison
swear they're innocent.

1154
01:25:10,219 --> 01:25:12,342
Don't ya think that's kinda funny?

1155
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,385
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.

1156
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:17,929
Excuse me.

1157
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:30,195
What you lookin' at, Ray?

1158
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:37,903
- Just what the fuck you lookin' at?
- I noticed that...

1159
01:25:38,665 --> 01:25:41,998
...I noticed you and Mr. Wilkins
been mighty friendly lately.

1160
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:44,208
Y'all wanna be a new couple or somethin'?

1161
01:25:44,295 --> 01:25:46,252
Kiss my ass.

1162
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:50,046
Mr. Wilkins just an old man
that like to talk.

1163
01:25:50,135 --> 01:25:52,672
That's all that is, Ray. That's all.

1164
01:25:53,512 --> 01:25:56,882
Y'all like to talk.
I'm lonely, and I like to talk too.

1165
01:25:56,975 --> 01:25:59,133
What you wanna talk about?

1166
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:03,349
I wanna talk about the plan
you've been working on.

1167
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:05,432
I ain't workin' on no plan!

1168
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:09,695
I know ya. And I know
when you got somethin' brewin'.

1169
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:12,695
What I got brewin'?

1170
01:26:13,575 --> 01:26:16,529
- You tell me!
- You done lost your damn mind.

1171
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:20,321
I don't care what you believe.

1172
01:26:20,498 --> 01:26:22,537
You got somethin' up your sleeve.

1173
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,748
Think I'm gonna stay up arguing with you?

1174
01:26:24,836 --> 01:26:28,454
You cuttin' into my sleepin' time.
Kiss my ass and good night.

1175
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:31,169
Go to sleep, nigger.
I hope it's the long one.

1176
01:26:31,259 --> 01:26:33,335
Why you talkin' instead of sleepin'?

1177
01:26:33,428 --> 01:26:35,669
I'm going to sleep. Why don't you?

1178
01:26:35,763 --> 01:26:38,930
Why can't I just sit here
and look at your ass?

1179
01:26:39,016 --> 01:26:41,508
And wonder what you got up your sleeve.

1180
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:43,145
I got somethin' brewin'.

1181
01:26:43,229 --> 01:26:46,645
I got an ass-whuppin' for ya
if you don't stop fuckin' with me.

1182
01:26:46,733 --> 01:26:49,484
- That's right.
- All right. Sleep tight.

1183
01:26:51,529 --> 01:26:55,147
I hope your ass piss the bed
with that weak-ass bladder of yours.

1184
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:59,025
If I do, then I'll put the sheets on you.
How you like that?

1185
01:27:07,795 --> 01:27:09,953
Where the hell you think you goin'?

1186
01:27:10,298 --> 01:27:14,462
Mr. Wilkins' driver got the flu,
and he asked me to fill in for him.

1187
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:17,841
How you gonna fill in for somebody?
You can't drive.

1188
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:20,765
You ain't got a license,
ain't drove in 40 years.

1189
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:23,176
He know you're takin' his life
into your hands?

1190
01:27:23,269 --> 01:27:26,223
- Shut up.
- No. Where the hell you goin'?

1191
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:30,641
- lf you must know...
- Then I must know. I got to know.

1192
01:27:30,735 --> 01:27:34,602
Greenville. Pick up the new
superintendent at the bus station.

1193
01:27:35,114 --> 01:27:37,688
What's with the old pretty suit?
You Harry Belafonte?

1194
01:27:37,783 --> 01:27:40,701
I look very dapper, very debonair, don't I?

1195
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:43,363
Now don't touch this car.

1196
01:27:44,081 --> 01:27:46,573
I piss on the motherfucker.
Ain't gonna touch it.

1197
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:50,665
- Why you got to say nasty shit?
- 'Cause I'm a nasty motherfucker.

1198
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:19,606
You know I trust you, Claude.

1199
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,693
- I hope so.
- Be right back.

1200
01:29:15,757 --> 01:29:17,417
What the fuck?

1201
01:29:54,671 --> 01:29:59,131
Naturally, I had to get set down next to
your proverbial hypochondriac...

1202
01:29:59,717 --> 01:30:02,718
...middle-aged fat lady
with a goddamn wart on her nose...

1203
01:30:02,804 --> 01:30:05,425
...hair growin' out of it, for Christ's sakes.

1204
01:30:05,515 --> 01:30:07,139
I tell ya, I got to know...

1205
01:30:07,225 --> 01:30:09,513
...her goddamn gall bladder...

1206
01:30:09,602 --> 01:30:11,974
...like the back of my goddamn hand.

1207
01:30:15,358 --> 01:30:17,350
Claude? Mr. Pike, Claude.

1208
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:20,730
There you go, boy.

1209
01:30:21,406 --> 01:30:23,482
Come on. It's time to go.

1210
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,950
Let me get that door for you.
You just stretch out.

1211
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,074
Now you're sure it was him.

1212
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:33,537
Some faces you just don't forget.

1213
01:30:33,668 --> 01:30:35,993
Warren Pike is one of 'em.

1214
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:42,926
Got a bird!

1215
01:30:47,473 --> 01:30:49,596
That's quite a haul.

1216
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:55,388
What d'ya say, Mr. Pike?
You about ready to call it a day?

1217
01:30:57,858 --> 01:30:59,816
Yeah, it's gettin' late...

1218
01:30:59,902 --> 01:31:02,654
...and I sure as hell could use
a nice, hot bath.

1219
01:31:02,864 --> 01:31:05,948
That's a mighty fine
timepiece you got there, Mr. Pike.

1220
01:31:06,033 --> 01:31:09,034
- Even play a fancy tune, huh?
- Yeah, it's special.

1221
01:31:09,328 --> 01:31:12,863
- They don't make 'em like that anymore.
- I'll bet they don't.

1222
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:18,408
Would you mind if I asked
where you got that from?

1223
01:31:19,047 --> 01:31:22,629
My wife gave it to me
on our anniversary some years back.

1224
01:31:25,678 --> 01:31:27,421
About 40 years back?

1225
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:33,596
Forty years. Yeah, something like that.

1226
01:31:35,021 --> 01:31:37,512
She give you that scar on your face too?

1227
01:31:37,607 --> 01:31:39,932
I oughta kill you for that remark.

1228
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:41,817
What's goin' on here?

1229
01:31:41,945 --> 01:31:45,147
I think I might just have
to teach this uppity nigger...

1230
01:31:45,406 --> 01:31:47,198
...a lesson in manners.

1231
01:31:48,951 --> 01:31:51,869
Ray, be cool. You gonna get us
in a lot of trouble now.

1232
01:31:51,954 --> 01:31:56,118
He's right, Gibson. You put that gun down,
or I'm gonna have to shoot ya.

1233
01:31:56,334 --> 01:31:59,169
Then we about to be
some shot-up motherfuckers.

1234
01:31:59,254 --> 01:32:01,163
Don't nobody shoot nobody. Ray...

1235
01:32:01,256 --> 01:32:05,585
...I wanna see this son of a bitch dead.
I don't wanna see you go down with him.

1236
01:32:05,676 --> 01:32:07,883
Give me the gun.

1237
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,759
He got my daddy's watch!
He killed Winston Hancock!

1238
01:32:10,848 --> 01:32:12,887
Don't listen to him. He's crazy.

1239
01:32:12,975 --> 01:32:16,724
- Stop. Think about what you're sayin'.
- I know what I'm sayin'!

1240
01:32:16,813 --> 01:32:19,304
That's the only thing
my daddy ever give me.

1241
01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:21,854
Is there any truth
in what this man is saying?

1242
01:32:21,943 --> 01:32:23,900
What the hell difference does it make?

1243
01:32:23,986 --> 01:32:27,984
At least the state of Mississippi got
40 years of cheap labor out of the deal.

1244
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:30,861
Motherfucker, you took our lives.
Gimme the gun.

1245
01:32:30,952 --> 01:32:33,822
- I'm gonna kill this motherfucker myself.
- No!

1246
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:35,573
Put it down, Pike!

1247
01:32:56,936 --> 01:32:59,059
I believe this belongs to me.

1248
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,285
My daddy's watch.

1249
01:33:17,206 --> 01:33:20,622
We were walkin' back.
A bird came out low on our left.

1250
01:33:21,335 --> 01:33:22,830
I swung on it.

1251
01:33:23,463 --> 01:33:26,298
Mr. Pike walked directly in my line of fire.

1252
01:33:26,424 --> 01:33:29,295
Where were the two convicts
when the shot was fired?

1253
01:33:29,385 --> 01:33:33,335
They were loadin' up the truck.
They'd gone on ahead.

1254
01:33:34,015 --> 01:33:36,221
Why don't he just tell him the truth?

1255
01:33:36,308 --> 01:33:39,393
Nobody wanna hear it.
He gonna tell 'em what they wanna hear.

1256
01:33:39,478 --> 01:33:42,016
- I don't know.
- We'll talk.

1257
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:49,773
Here he comes.

1258
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:56,697
I think they bought it. One of the deputies
is a member of my church.

1259
01:33:57,163 --> 01:34:00,164
Gibson, I don't think there's any way that...

1260
01:34:03,294 --> 01:34:04,622
...I could, uh...

1261
01:34:05,964 --> 01:34:07,623
Claude...

1262
01:34:09,717 --> 01:34:12,387
There's no way to make up for 40 years.

1263
01:34:15,097 --> 01:34:16,971
I'll get Charlie to...

1264
01:34:17,683 --> 01:34:20,388
...to draw up your pardon papers
in the morning.

1265
01:34:22,188 --> 01:34:25,354
- Would you mind helpin' me upstairs?
- Sure, boss.

1266
01:34:26,651 --> 01:34:28,310
I'm not your boss.

1267
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:30,941
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.

1268
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:36,697
So Ray and Claude
get their pardons, right?

1269
01:34:36,785 --> 01:34:38,992
No, ain't get their pardons, man.

1270
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:43,623
If they got their pardons back then,
we wouldn't be buryin' them today.

1271
01:34:44,043 --> 01:34:45,419
- That's right.
- Damn.

1272
01:34:45,503 --> 01:34:47,994
What happened is old man Wilkins...

1273
01:34:48,548 --> 01:34:50,836
...never come out of the bathroom.

1274
01:34:51,384 --> 01:34:54,089
Sat right there and died on the shitter.

1275
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,253
That must've been pretty messed up
for them.

1276
01:34:59,642 --> 01:35:02,513
What happened to them after that,
old-timer?

1277
01:35:03,646 --> 01:35:05,935
Let's see. What happened after that?

1278
01:35:06,441 --> 01:35:07,685
Oh, yeah!

1279
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:09,609
They got old.

1280
01:35:12,488 --> 01:35:14,280
Shit. We all got old.

1281
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:19,618
And getting out
took on a whole new meaning.

1282
01:35:20,455 --> 01:35:23,075
Looks like Jonsey got his walking papers.

1283
01:35:23,332 --> 01:35:24,992
Yeah, there he go.

1284
01:35:25,376 --> 01:35:28,460
Over to the morgue,
up the hill to the cemetery.

1285
01:35:30,256 --> 01:35:33,791
You were right
when you said what you said.

1286
01:35:33,885 --> 01:35:36,637
You said we wasn't never
gonna get out of this place.

1287
01:35:36,721 --> 01:35:40,932
And you were right. You said
the only way we gonna get outta here...

1288
01:35:41,183 --> 01:35:43,426
...is through the morgue and the cemetery.

1289
01:35:43,519 --> 01:35:46,188
And you're right, 'cause we right here.

1290
01:35:46,689 --> 01:35:48,183
Right here, right now.

1291
01:35:48,274 --> 01:35:50,480
Yeah, I remember saying that.

1292
01:35:50,985 --> 01:35:53,310
We next. Let's be real.

1293
01:35:54,406 --> 01:35:57,774
We next. You like baseball? We on deck.

1294
01:35:58,451 --> 01:36:01,488
- On deck for what?
- For what? That upper room, nigger.

1295
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:03,157
'The upper room

1296
01:36:04,415 --> 01:36:05,993
'When Jesus... '

1297
01:36:09,462 --> 01:36:12,213
Know where that is,
the upper room they're singin' about?

1298
01:36:12,298 --> 01:36:14,836
- 'The upper room'
- Yeah, I'll tell you what.

1299
01:36:15,218 --> 01:36:18,172
You die first,
I'm gonna sing at your funeral.

1300
01:36:18,262 --> 01:36:22,094
I'm gonna just bust up
in the motherfucker and go 'Upper room.'

1301
01:36:22,934 --> 01:36:26,718
Let 'em shoot me. I don't give a fuck
if they take me out singin'.

1302
01:36:26,938 --> 01:36:29,061
- You crazy, Ray.
- Hell, yeah.

1303
01:36:32,819 --> 01:36:34,016
Friend.

1304
01:36:35,154 --> 01:36:36,696
Yeah. We next.

1305
01:36:41,619 --> 01:36:43,492
I wanna be at the game. I'm on a roll.

1306
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:46,703
'Mama and my daddy don't know how'

1307
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:49,827
Two Percodan. There you go.
Gimme what you got.

1308
01:36:50,086 --> 01:36:51,580
I'll raise ya.

1309
01:36:52,255 --> 01:36:54,377
Yo, what the fuck are those?

1310
01:36:55,591 --> 01:36:57,833
It helps keep the cholesterol down.

1311
01:36:57,927 --> 01:37:02,719
Do I look like I give a damn
about my cholesterol?

1312
01:37:07,854 --> 01:37:11,353
- You want a bump, G?
- No, I don't want none of that shit.

1313
01:37:11,524 --> 01:37:14,311
- That's right.
- I wouldn't put that in my nose.

1314
01:37:14,402 --> 01:37:16,893
- You know how they get it in here?
- Tell him how.

1315
01:37:16,988 --> 01:37:18,980
People smuggle it in... in their ass.

1316
01:37:19,073 --> 01:37:22,158
- Say what?
- I know the motherfucker that bring it in.

1317
01:37:23,411 --> 01:37:26,661
That come out of somebody's asshole,
so go on, enjoy.

1318
01:37:26,747 --> 01:37:28,408
I know if I got to get high...

1319
01:37:28,499 --> 01:37:31,073
...I got to smell some shit,
I ain't gonna have none.

1320
01:37:31,169 --> 01:37:33,375
That ain't high. That's low.

1321
01:37:33,796 --> 01:37:37,497
That cocaine, heroin, marijuana,
all that shit, bring it all in here...

1322
01:37:37,592 --> 01:37:39,632
...in their ass.

1323
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:42,388
Look like it's up to you, ass-sniffer.

1324
01:37:43,055 --> 01:37:45,547
Boys, come and get it! Jell-O!

1325
01:37:48,227 --> 01:37:50,434
- Jell-O pudding!
- Play one more hand.

1326
01:37:50,521 --> 01:37:52,430
- I'm gonna get my Jell-O.
- Come on.

1327
01:37:52,523 --> 01:37:56,437
Y'all gonna take all my money and
go run off 'cause nurse said 'Jell-O.'

1328
01:37:56,527 --> 01:37:58,152
- Ray.
- I don't want no Jell-O.

1329
01:37:58,237 --> 01:38:00,360
I ain't said nothin' about the Jell-O.

1330
01:38:00,448 --> 01:38:03,615
I was thinkin' about
what we talked about this afternoon.

1331
01:38:03,701 --> 01:38:06,074
- I think I got a plan.
- You got a plan?

1332
01:38:07,789 --> 01:38:09,532
I'm a visionary on this one.

1333
01:38:09,624 --> 01:38:12,161
- You got it all worked out?
- I think I really do.

1334
01:38:12,251 --> 01:38:14,208
Listen here. Any plan you got...

1335
01:38:14,295 --> 01:38:17,082
...I don't even wanna hear
'cause I know it's fucked up.

1336
01:38:17,173 --> 01:38:18,667
All fucked up.

1337
01:38:19,175 --> 01:38:21,381
If you don't wanna believe me, don't.

1338
01:38:21,761 --> 01:38:25,260
I'm too old. I ain't got time for no plan.
I'm 90 years old.

1339
01:38:25,348 --> 01:38:28,883
I never thought I'd see the day
that old Ray Gibson give up hope.

1340
01:38:28,976 --> 01:38:30,684
- Never thought...
- Say what now?

1341
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:33,605
I said I never thought I'd hear the day...

1342
01:38:34,023 --> 01:38:35,981
...that old Ray Gibson give up hope.

1343
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:38,225
I ain't give up no motherfuckin' hope.

1344
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:41,522
I'm keepin' it real like them niggers
in here keep it real.

1345
01:38:41,614 --> 01:38:44,022
Ain't nobody give up nothin'.

1346
01:38:44,116 --> 01:38:46,868
- You'd probably slow me down anyway.
- Said which?

1347
01:38:46,953 --> 01:38:48,233
You'd slow me down.

1348
01:38:48,329 --> 01:38:50,998
You must be high if you think
I'd slow you down.

1349
01:38:51,082 --> 01:38:54,248
- I got a plan.
- I tell you what. Fuck your plan.

1350
01:38:55,295 --> 01:38:58,544
Lou. Cover that up.
Don't nobody wanna see that shit.

1351
01:38:58,631 --> 01:39:01,798
- Put your drawers on or something.
- Oh, cover it up.

1352
01:39:01,884 --> 01:39:03,544
Don't touch it.

1353
01:39:03,636 --> 01:39:07,634
That turn my stomach. I don't want
no Jell-O after I seen them old-ass balls.

1354
01:39:07,723 --> 01:39:11,009
Who gonna enjoy Jell-O
after I seen what I've seen?

1355
01:39:11,269 --> 01:39:14,269
I don't even want Jell-O.
Lou ruin my stomach.

1356
01:39:31,331 --> 01:39:33,122
Anybody seen Claude?

1357
01:39:36,294 --> 01:39:38,867
I been here the whole time.
He ain't come out.

1358
01:39:39,171 --> 01:39:42,042
- Claude ain't out!
- Claude has died, God!

1359
01:39:45,094 --> 01:39:46,754
No, Ray, don't go!

1360
01:39:50,475 --> 01:39:52,883
- Claude!
- Ray, you can't go in there!

1361
01:39:52,977 --> 01:39:54,934
- Ray, come back!
- Claude!

1362
01:39:57,982 --> 01:39:59,180
Claude!

1363
01:40:11,871 --> 01:40:14,492
- How did it start?
- Probably old wires.

1364
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:18,328
Place was a tinderbox just waitin' to go.

1365
01:40:18,878 --> 01:40:22,876
I guess we should've torn
this old building down a long time ago.

1366
01:40:23,216 --> 01:40:27,130
Gibson made it this far before
he was probably overcome by smoke.

1367
01:40:27,261 --> 01:40:30,844
From the looks of things,
Banks didn't even make it out of bed.

1368
01:40:35,603 --> 01:40:37,595
You really bummed me out.

1369
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:40,140
That's a terrible story.

1370
01:40:42,694 --> 01:40:43,808
You cryin'?

1371
01:40:43,903 --> 01:40:46,524
No, I got allergies. I'm cool.

1372
01:40:47,365 --> 01:40:48,824
Oh, my God.

1373
01:40:50,201 --> 01:40:53,237
Ain't nothin' wrong with a man cryin'
every now and again.

1374
01:40:53,329 --> 01:40:56,247
So what was Claude's plan, anyway?

1375
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:58,665
Claude figured...

1376
01:40:58,835 --> 01:41:01,789
...he could steal a couple of bodies
from the morgue, right?

1377
01:41:01,879 --> 01:41:04,549
That way,
when he set the infirmary on fire...

1378
01:41:04,715 --> 01:41:07,420
...in all the commotion,
him and Ray could just...

1379
01:41:07,677 --> 01:41:10,002
...slip right onto them fire engines, see?

1380
01:41:10,096 --> 01:41:12,254
Hide out, wait until the mornin'...

1381
01:41:12,348 --> 01:41:14,756
...and roll right on out with 'em.

1382
01:41:15,476 --> 01:41:19,177
That way, when they find the two bodies,
they think it was them.

1383
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:21,597
What makes you think that ain't work?

1384
01:41:24,903 --> 01:41:27,025
I never said it didn't work.

1385
01:41:29,365 --> 01:41:33,198
You mean this is not Ray and Claude
in these two boxes?

1386
01:41:35,621 --> 01:41:37,413
Is it, old man?

1387
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:41,249
Hey, old-timer, is it?

1388
01:41:58,269 --> 01:41:59,728
- See?
- I like that.

1389
01:41:59,812 --> 01:42:02,517
You feel part of this baseball game,
don't you?

1390
01:42:02,732 --> 01:42:04,689
They only get one out of me today.

1391
01:42:04,775 --> 01:42:07,611
We were arguing about something.

1392
01:42:08,404 --> 01:42:11,689
I didn't appreciate
when you said something about...

1393
01:42:12,366 --> 01:42:14,406
You had just said I was...

1394
01:42:15,661 --> 01:42:17,239
You said that, uh...

1395
01:42:18,414 --> 01:42:20,371
Hell with it.

1396
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:22,367
It's a hell of a day for a ball game.

1397
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:25,378
- Yankees on fire.
- Motherfuckers kickin' ass.

1398
01:42:26,088 --> 01:42:29,374
- Which ones the Yankees?
- Well, the ones up at the mound.

1399
01:42:30,885 --> 01:42:32,510
Go, go, you! Run!

1400
01:42:34,138 --> 01:42:36,012
That's the Yankees right there.

1401
01:42:36,098 --> 01:42:38,850
- Which ones there?
- That's the Yankees right there.

1402
01:42:38,935 --> 01:42:40,844
It's a perfect plan. We're out.

1403
01:42:40,937 --> 01:42:43,807
What's so perfect?
Took 65 years to come up with it.

1404
01:42:43,898 --> 01:42:45,890
Why can't you just say thank you?

1405
01:42:45,983 --> 01:42:48,653
You want me to say thank you,
you can kiss my ass too.

1406
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:54,114
I'm ready to go back right now.

1407
01:42:55,451 --> 01:42:57,942
Then let's go, Ray.

1408
01:42:59,789 --> 01:43:02,161
Help a nigger!
Don't make me stand in this cold.

1409
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,919
Your bitch'd be standing... I'm sorry.

1410
01:43:05,461 --> 01:43:08,747
Fuck around with me, it's gonna
be consequences and repercussions.

1411
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,631
- What's repercussions?
- Uh-oh.

1412
01:43:20,935 --> 01:43:22,513
Let me get that.

1413
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:25,521
I know it's 1932.

1414
01:43:25,857 --> 01:43:28,145
I'm the first one to have this.

1415
01:43:30,403 --> 01:43:33,357
Hey, watch... Shit.
I almost got stung by a bee.

1416
01:43:34,199 --> 01:43:36,820
You were scared, huh? Don't be scared.

1417
01:43:37,535 --> 01:43:39,694
Don't be scared, and don't laugh either.

1418
01:43:39,787 --> 01:43:41,661
'Cause it ain't funny.

1419
01:43:42,707 --> 01:43:44,866
That boy got God-given talent.

1420
01:43:45,168 --> 01:43:46,661
God made his...

1421
01:43:48,504 --> 01:43:50,711
What's wrong? The moustache too big?

1422
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,920
He give up hope, hung himself
because of the airplane that's coming over.

1423
01:43:59,015 --> 01:44:01,720
Make me have to loop this shit.
I ain't loopin' shit!

1424
01:44:01,809 --> 01:44:03,517
We get it now or not at all!

1425
01:44:03,602 --> 01:44:05,891
My name Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg.

1426
01:44:09,025 --> 01:44:10,898
You think that's funny?

1427
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,148
That's probably the last time. Sorry.

1428
01:44:16,241 --> 01:44:17,189
MY bad.

1429
01:44:19,535 --> 01:44:21,658
This ain't my daddy's watch.
