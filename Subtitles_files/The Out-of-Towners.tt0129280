1
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,342
<i>Our life</i>

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,344
<i>Together</i>

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,676
<i>Is so precious</i>

4
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>Together</i>

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,816
<i>We have grown</i>

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,856
<i>We have grown</i>

7
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>Although our love</i>

8
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,453
<i>Is still special</i>

9
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:39,201
<i>Let's take a chance
and fly away</i>

10
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,207
<i>Somewhere</i>

11
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,210
<i>Alone</i>

12
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,712
<i>It's been too long
since we took the time</i>

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,546
<i>No one's to blame,
My, the time flies so quickly</i>

14
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:00,490
<i>But when
I see you, darling</i>

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,462
<i>It's like we both
are falling</i>

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,828
<i>In love again</i>

17
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:11,836
<i>It'll be just
like starting over</i>

18
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:13,838
<i>Over</i>

19
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:17,103
<i>Starting over</i>

20
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:18,939
<i>Over</i>

21
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,502
<i>Every day we
used to make love</i>

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,517
<i>Why can't we be
making love nice and easy?</i>

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:34,359
<i>It's time to spread
our wings and fly</i>

24
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:40,366
<i>Don't let another day
go by, my love</i>

25
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,564
<i>Itll be just
like starting over</i>

26
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,163
<i>Over and
over and over</i>

27
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,267
<i>Why don't we
take off alone?</i>

28
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,878
<i>La de da</i>

29
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:58,383
<i>Take a trip
somewhere far, far away</i>

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:03,150
<i>We'll be together
all alone again</i>

31
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,246
Alan, Alan.

32
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:05,290
Hey, what's up, Dad?

33
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,290
Uh, you're boarding
in a few minutes.

34
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,257
I'm gonna go
find your mother.

35
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,350
Dad, relax.

36
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,792
She just doesn't want us
to see her crying.

37
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,295
So she went
to the bathroom

38
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,695
to cry in front of
strangers, of course.

39
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,959
How about you, Dad?

40
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,864
You sad to see me
finally leave home?

41
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,300
Look, Alan,
you're going abroad

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,632
for the first time.

43
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:19,796
You're gonna be
in a foreign country.

44
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:22,204
You might even, you
know, go to Amsterdam.

45
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,606
And, you know,
just... just...

46
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,268
European women
are different.

47
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,504
How do you know?

48
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,069
James Bond films, mostly,
but still, that doesn't...

49
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,944
Guys, look at Mommy!

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,314
Oh, that
was so cute.

51
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,317
Hi, honey.

52
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,318
Hi.

53
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,319
Dad here
was starting

54
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,320
to get worried
about you.

55
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,822
Oh, Daddy should
worry about himself.

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,482
He can't admit how much
he's gonna miss you.

57
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,322
See, that's the difference
between us.

58
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,986
I get it out
and I let it go,

59
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,495
and he gets a headache.

60
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,826
Well, maybe I wouldn't
get a headache

61
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,331
if you didn't get it out
and let it go.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,765
No, you get a headache

63
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:49,892
because you don't
express your feelings,

64
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,266
and that's why you
grind your teeth at night.

65
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,998
- Well, maybe if...
- Guys,

66
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,198
can we not have
this moment?

67
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:55,467
Oh, ok, sorry.

68
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,974
Could you take
that, sweetie?

69
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,340
Look, I've got
something for you.

70
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,436
It is an international
beeper.

71
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,674
And all you have to do
is press that little button,

72
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,181
and anywhere you
are on the planet,

73
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,047
it will ring on
my corresponding unit.

74
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,847
- And then what?
- And then I'll call you.

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,285
And if you don't answer,
she'll fly over.

76
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,823
Charter flight 178
to London

77
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,416
is now boarding
at gate 50-b.

78
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,257
All Ohio State students should have
their boarding cards ready.

79
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,093
So, I guess
this is it.

80
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,290
Give your mother
a big hug.

81
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,393
She's very
fragile today.

82
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,705
I think Daddy's
a wreck, ok,

83
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,140
so make sure
you call him, ok?

84
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,073
Ok...

85
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,842
you guys take care
of each other.

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,814
I was really proud
of you back there.

87
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,484
I thought you
were gonna lose it.

88
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,482
Yeah, so was I. I guess
I'm stronger than I think.

89
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,281
And, look
at it this way,

90
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,787
we have more time
to ourselves now.

91
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,484
Just us.
Just you and me,

92
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:21,856
alone in the house.

93
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,163
It's ok, it's ok.

94
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,531
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,035
You know,
you should be

96
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,536
excited about
this interview.

97
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,038
If it goes well, we're
moving to New York.

98
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,130
We'll have more money,

99
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,299
and we'll have
that "New York" money.

100
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,309
I don't want any more
money, Henry.

101
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,811
You've been at
Sellinski for 23 years.

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,814
You have a good job,

103
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,680
and we've lived
in Ohio all our lives.

104
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,548
Besides, I thought
you hated New York.

105
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,712
I only hated New York

106
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:49,811
when it was hip
to hate New York.

107
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,913
Now it's not hip
to hate it anymore,

108
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,252
so I don't hate it.

109
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,416
I'm in advertising.

110
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,891
I'm weak, and
I follow the crowd.

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,726
Well, I guess we
could see Susan more.

112
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,731
Maybe you can.
She won't speak to me.

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,528
Well, yeah, I mean,
you know, when she calls up

114
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,193
and says she's having second
thoughts about med school

115
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,703
and you blow up at her,
I mean, it's like...

116
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,363
I didn't blow up at her.

117
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,771
- Yes, you did, Henry.
- I did not. I merely told her

118
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,537
that I was
going to sue her.

119
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,636
Oh, you can't sue your own
daughter for lost tuition.

120
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,647
You can now. You can.
No, there's that precedent.

121
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,546
It's Mr. Brown vs.
Muffy the daughter.

122
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,549
Oh, my God!

123
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,786
Yeah, hang on.
Hang on one second.

124
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,093
Yeah, Tony,
yeah, thanks.

125
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,689
Thanks for setting up
that meeting.

126
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,291
I'm going, 10:00.

127
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:14,271
Tony, I can't tell Nancy
I was fired.

128
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,602
I know.

129
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,767
I know, it's
very caveman of me,

130
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,107
but that's what
I've decided...

131
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,942
Yeah, well,
you're not Nancy.

132
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,608
Ok, but listen,
I appreciate it.

133
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,446
Ok, thanks, bye.

134
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,533
There's too much food.

135
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,304
No, there's not.

136
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,307
I could never get enough
to eat when Alan was here.

137
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,639
Now, pass me those
potatoes, baby.

138
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,304
This is fantastic. We
never get a chance to talk.

139
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,076
When the kids were here,
we only talked about them.

140
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,810
Now we get
to talk about us.

141
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,318
I mean,
this is a gab-fest.

142
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,719
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak.

143
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,051
So...

144
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,087
uh...

145
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,888
what's going on
with you?

146
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,025
I have absolutely
no idea

147
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:18,968
what I'm going to do
with the rest of my life.

148
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,471
I can't even decide

149
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,370
whether I should go
to New York with you

150
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,875
for that interview.
I'd just be tagging along

151
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:28,174
out of pure panic
and insecurity.

152
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,078
You know, but it's ironic

153
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,810
that the minute
we have time together

154
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,342
that we, like,
immediately separate.

155
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,787
Although, if we force
ourselves to be together

156
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,791
instead of letting it
happen naturally,

157
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,350
what are we proving?

158
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,954
Well,

159
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,966
I don't know what
to tell you, baby.

160
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,808
I gotta pack.

161
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,242
Good morning, sir.

162
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,248
How are you?

163
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,375
I'm fine, thank you.

164
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,769
Flight Attendant: Welcome aboard
Tri-State Air flight 42

165
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,433
to New York.

166
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,637
If you'd make sure seat belts
are securely fastened,

167
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,441
we'll be able
to pull away...

168
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,503
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

169
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,678
Ohh!

170
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,515
Surprise!

171
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,337
Henry?

172
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,201
Henry?

173
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,373
Henry?!

174
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,377
What?

175
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,471
Are you
excited I came?

176
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,708
What?

177
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,216
Are you
excited I came?

178
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,014
I'm very excited.

179
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,823
'Cause you don't
sound excited, Henry.

180
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,657
I'm holding it in.

181
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,629
He's excited.
We're all excited, ok?

182
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,258
Oh, Henry, you forgot
your foot chums.

183
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,562
What?

184
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,035
Your foot chums.

185
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,332
Aah!

186
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,270
Here, could you pass
these down, please,

187
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,967
over there to that man?

188
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,340
No, that's...

189
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,776
Oh, and he
always forgets this.

190
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:41,835
For the whole trip,

191
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,108
he'll be complaining
about his rash.

192
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,046
Could you
pass that down?

193
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,083
For the next 2 days,

194
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,175
it's gonna be scratch,
scratch, scratch,

195
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,152
flake, flake, flake.

196
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,279
Uhh!

197
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,789
Man: Let them
sit together.

198
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,325
Thanks.

199
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,985
Here we go.

200
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,289
Oh, uh, sorry. We're
not gonna be eating.

201
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,386
Ok.

202
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,452
Don't you think

203
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,589
we should have
a little something, Henry?

204
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,724
Baby, we're
gonna be eating

205
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,165
in one of the great
hotels in the world.

206
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,293
You don't want to ruin that

207
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,532
with a moldy leftover
ham and cheese sandwich.

208
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,800
He's sorry.

209
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:09,863
That's ok.

210
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,204
Besides, I'm
too nervous to eat.

211
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,540
Why are you nervous?
It's only an interview.

212
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,204
It's not like you
don't have a job.

213
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,304
Well, this is different.

214
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,315
It's Senior
Creative Director.

215
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,613
It's the big time.

216
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,881
It'll be all right,
honey.

217
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,650
Great city, isn't it?

218
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,318
All I see is fog.

219
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,328
Pilot: Well, folks,
bad news this afternoon.

220
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:33,330
New York is
completely fogged in.

221
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,629
We've been diverted to
Logan Airport in Boston.

222
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,693
- Boston?
- Boston?

223
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,099
We're here.

224
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,730
I'll see if there's any flights
going anywhere near New York.

225
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,240
All right,
and I'll get the bags.

226
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,332
I'll meet you
at the carousel.

227
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,842
Ok.

228
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,139
Henry?

229
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,975
Yes, I'm still
excited you came.

230
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:55,947
Bags.

231
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,755
Ooh!

232
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,297
The buses are filled
until 3:00 in the morning.

233
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,128
The next train to New York
from South Station

234
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,963
is in 20 minutes.

235
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,313
There's a train
in 20 minutes,

236
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,442
gets us into New York...

237
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,450
Where... Where
are the bags?

238
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,451
They didn't come out.

239
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,078
What do you mean
they didn't come out?

240
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,588
I can't say it any simpler
than that, Henry.

241
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,147
They didn't come out.

242
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,419
What do you mean
they didn't come out?

243
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,687
Calm down, Henry.

244
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,785
How can I calm down?

245
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,829
I've got to be in
New York tomorrow morning

246
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,158
for the most important
interview of my...

247
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,823
just give me the claim...
the check... give me...

248
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:41,923
Henry!

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,933
Excuse me!

250
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,333
Are there any more
bags up there?

251
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,496
We were supposed
to land...

252
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:47,663
Are you crazy?

253
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,331
Listen, I'm Henry Clark
from flight 42.

254
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,376
It's 3-6-4...

255
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:52,637
You're gonna
get hurt!

256
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,702
6- T-dash-7... Ohh!

257
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,340
That's not our bag!

258
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,284
Can you describe
the bags?

259
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,787
Yes, I have
a brown suitcase,

260
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:04,879
a brown garment bag,

261
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,152
and 3 blue sportsacs.

262
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,159
Mr. Clark, many bags
look alike.

263
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,525
In most cases,
specific descriptions

264
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,531
lead to apprehending
the suspect.

265
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,793
My bags didn't
murder anyone.

266
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:17,061
They just got lost.

267
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,397
Henry,
look at this.

268
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,903
All right, um,

269
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,497
my suitcase looks
something like that.

270
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:27,204
Would that be the 24-
or the 26-inch model?

271
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,803
Gee, honey, in my rush
to leave the house,

272
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,177
I forgot to
measure my bags.

273
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,682
Oh, it looks
a little like this.

274
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,683
It's kinda rough,

275
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,344
but it'll
give you an idea.

276
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,480
Wow! Are you an artist?

277
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,650
Well, I used to be in advertising
with my husband.

278
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,422
This is
a fantastic drawing.

279
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,484
Thank you.

280
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,293
Unfortunately,
we don't have that bag.

281
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,767
Where will you be staying
in the Boston area?

282
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,964
In the Boston area, we will
be staying in New York.

283
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,836
Oh, Henry, calm down.
There's plenty of cabs.

284
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,340
It's not worth getting
a heart attack over.

285
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,842
You know, I should
have eaten something.

286
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,138
You know how dizzy
I get when I don't eat.

287
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,338
I'm, like, reeling.

288
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,040
I know. Well, there's
plenty of food on the train.

289
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,776
You just have
to go with the flow.

290
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,283
All right, you're right,
you're right.

291
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:07,784
I'm calming down.
I am going to calm down.

292
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,047
Good.

293
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,487
Thank you,
thank you.

294
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,490
What's that taste?

295
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,492
- What taste?
- Did you have peanut butter?

296
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,494
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where did you get peanut butter?

297
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:18,756
I didn't have
peanut butter, Henry.

298
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,956
But you usually don't
taste like peanut butter.

299
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,761
Well, that's it. I'm
throwing away that lipstick.

300
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,095
You had peanut butter.

301
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,100
I did not.

302
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,101
Yes, you did.

303
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,194
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

304
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,568
All right,
I confess, ok?

305
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,799
I went to
the vending machine

306
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,806
while I was waiting
for the bags.

307
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,807
Aha!

308
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,104
I had 75 cents.

309
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,610
I put it into
the vending machine,

310
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:34,804
it didn't
make change,

311
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,177
and so I
ate them all!

312
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,647
How many were there?

313
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,648
2.

314
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,649
2? And I'm dizzy.

315
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,151
Oh, Henry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

316
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,652
It doesn't mean
I don't love you.

317
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,154
I, uh, hate
to interrupt,

318
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,314
but are we
going anywhere?

319
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,823
Oh, my God! I thought
we were already moving.

320
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,087
South Station. We have
10 minutes to catch a train.

321
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,628
Oh, my God!

322
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,330
Henry: Come on, come on,
we can make it!

323
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,997
All right, all right.

324
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,134
Aah!

325
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:05,437
Ohh!

326
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,943
Did we miss it?

327
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,277
Uh, the 3:38
to New York?

328
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:11,372
Yeah.

329
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,781
We missed it.

330
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,148
This can't be happening.

331
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,380
Oh, Henry, if you're
a little late,

332
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,820
they won't mind.
They'll understand.

333
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,254
They do not give a position
of responsibility

334
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:22,020
to a man who cannot get
from Ohio to New York

335
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,118
in 24 hours.

336
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,287
But in the world
of advertising,

337
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:25,795
I really don't think
that makes any difference.

338
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,526
If you want to be
a messenger, maybe.

339
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,158
Do I have time to
go to the bathroom?

340
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:31,600
All the time
in the world.

341
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,602
Ok.

342
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,729
And don't worry, honey,

343
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,363
we'll get the next
train to New York.

344
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,908
No, we'll rent a car.
They... They don't leave without you,

345
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:39,876
and they don't get
diverted to Boston.

346
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,810
Ok. Ok, sweetie,
whatever.

347
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,812
I'll meet you...

348
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,870
5 minutes.

349
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,065
Excuse me.

350
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,667
Your attention, please.

351
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:15,372
The 3:38 Metroliner
to New York

352
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,972
is now leaving
on Track 12.

353
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,983
This is your
final boarding call.

354
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,279
All aboard!

355
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,980
Nancy?

356
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,488
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

357
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,286
Excuse me?
Excuse me? Ohh!

358
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,452
Excuse me, can you tell me
where the ladies' room is?

359
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,790
You mean the men's room.

360
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:31,794
No, I don't need
the men's room,

361
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:32,795
I need
the ladies' room.

362
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:33,796
Over there.

363
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:34,797
Ohh!

364
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:35,798
Nancy? Nancy,

365
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,300
we can still
make the train.

366
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,802
We can still... uhh.

367
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,428
Excuse me, can you go in
there and get my wife, please?

368
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,530
It's an emergency.
She's wearing a brown coat,

369
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,541
she has a blue dress,
uh, blonde hair,

370
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,304
and... just thanks, thanks.

371
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,811
Henry, I got lost.

372
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,312
Nancy, we can still
make the train.

373
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,643
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

374
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:51,875
Henry, I have to go...

375
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,882
No, no, we don't have time.
It leaves in 2 minutes.

376
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,976
The train's
still here?

377
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,954
She didn't want
to come out!

378
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,257
This way, this way,
this way! Come on, come on!

379
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:03,589
Ok.

380
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,764
I'll run on ahead.

381
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:11,461
Run ahead of me.
I can't in these heels.

382
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:13,765
Oh, my God!

383
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:15,465
Hold it!

384
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,474
Hold it! Ok.

385
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,975
Oh, it's here.

386
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,512
All right. Ok.

387
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,514
Oh, on a full bladder,
I made it.

388
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,015
Oh, I forgive you
the peanut butter.

389
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,516
Ok. Come on,
I'm exhausted.

390
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,916
Let's see if we
can get a seat.

391
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,318
Ohh.

392
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,117
Oh.

393
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,055
Excuse me,

394
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,786
is this the 3:38
to New York?

395
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,987
No, that is.

396
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,265
Oh.

397
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,304
Hertz, nothing, Avis,
nothing, Budget, nothing.

398
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,635
We've gotta find a car.

399
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,970
I know. We have
to be nice, Henry.

400
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,100
We have to be nice.

401
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,269
Gotta be nice.

402
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,607
Yeah. The guy at Avis
didn't like you very much.

403
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,112
We were both in
a bad mood. Be nice.

404
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,170
Hi, can I help you folks?

405
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,910
Well, yes, but
first, how are you?

406
00:16:58,984 --> 00:16:59,973
Fine.

407
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,416
Oh, great. Well,
we'd like to rent a car.

408
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,249
Great. Compact,
midsize, or luxury?

409
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,957
Ah, compact.

410
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,114
Ok.

411
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,455
Oh, actually, we're
all out of compacts.

412
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,757
Oh, midsize
would be fine.

413
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,558
Ok.

414
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:14,655
Oops, actually,

415
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:16,495
we don't have any midsized
vehicles either.

416
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,364
All we have is
one luxury sedan.

417
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:19,596
Huh.

418
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,103
Well, I'm not sure
why you asked, then,

419
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,264
what car we...

420
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,240
We'll take
a luxury sedan.

421
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,240
Ok.

422
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,367
Sounds good.

423
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,674
You know, honey, they should
really change this sign

424
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,772
to "we have car. "

425
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,113
If I could have
your credit card?

426
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,277
Absolutely.

427
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:36,786
I think you'll
enjoy the car, sir.

428
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:37,946
It's totally
state-of-the-art.

429
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,284
Practically
drives itself.

430
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:40,949
Would you like the
collision insurance?

431
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,287
Well, if the car
drives itself

432
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,452
and we have
an accident,

433
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,961
then it would be
the car's fault, right?

434
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,631
<i>People all
over the world</i>

435
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:55,637

<i>Let it ride</i>

452
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,560
Boy,
it's hot in here.

453
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:19,755
Ohh! It tells you
everything about a heater

454
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,525
except how
to shut it off.

455
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,623
Oh, perfect.

456
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,258
Oh, Henry, what
are we gonna do?

457
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,064
I'm melting
out of my dress.

458
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,161
I don't understand.

459
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,830
It's got an engage
switch but no disengage.

460
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:29,838
Oh, it's a thousand
degrees in here.

461
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,772
It's like a setting
for a pot roast.

462
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,776
Honey, it's freezing!
Put that up!

463
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:35,277
It feels so good.

464
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:37,337
Oh, jeez!

465
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,250
<i>Isn't it romantic?</i>

466
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,251
Ohh!

467
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,617
Mmm!

468
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,754
Henry, are we in a rut?

469
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,628
No way.
I might be in a rut,

470
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,961
but we're
not in a rut.

471
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,501
Why are you in a rut?

472
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,298
Well, same thing
every day,

473
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,804
knowing exactly
what to expect.

474
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:03,237
That's a rut.

475
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,741
Well, I'm in more
of a rut than you are,

476
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,438
'cause ever since
Alan's been gone,

477
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,446
every morning I wake up

478
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,312
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

479
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,011
It's been one morning.

480
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,748
Well, I didn't say
a long rut,

481
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,881
but it's a start.

482
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:21,754
So we're both
in a rut.

483
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,952
Separately.

484
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:24,756
I might be in a rut and
you might be in a rut,

485
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,763
but we are
not in a rut,

486
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,423
because if we were in
a rut, that would be...

487
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,195
That would be
a real rut, Henry.

488
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,807
<i>Old black magic
has me in its spell</i>

489
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,809
Henry: Ok, there's
a fork coming up.

490
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:40,775
Which way do I go?

491
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:43,279
Ok, um, do you
see a sign that says,

492
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:44,609
"Cross Bronx Expressway"?

493
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:45,774
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

494
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,942
Good.

495
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,278
Ok, go past that...

496
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,787
What do you mean
go past it?

497
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,483
Then you'll hit a sign
that'll say "Triborough Bridge. "

498
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:55,184
Itll take you
right into Manhattan.

499
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:56,692
I already made the turn.

500
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,692
What do you mean
you turned?

501
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:58,693
I made the turn.

502
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,195
I didn't tell
you to turn.

503
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:01,788
- You implied it.
- I did not imply it.

504
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:02,798
You did, too.

505
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,300
No, how can you
imply a turn?

506
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:06,302
I wouldn't even know
how to imply a turn.

507
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,861
Let me tell you, you
know how to imply a turn.

508
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,804
Is that a map
in front of you or what?

509
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,809
Oh, well, gee,
I don't know, Henry.

510
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:16,608
I'm not a cartographer,
but it looks like a map.

511
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,511
It's got a lot of squiggly
little lines all over it.

512
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,879
You want to see?

513
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,612
Hey! That's
not funny.

514
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,414
<i>Oh, you're the lover
I have waited for</i>

515
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:31,325
<i>You're the mate that
fate had me created for</i>

516
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:33,886
Ok, just stay to the right,
right up here.

517
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:35,329
Are you sure, Henry?

518
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,333
Why don't we use
that navigation system?

519
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:38,993
Honey, I'm in charge
of the map now.

520
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,003
You just go straight
across the Triborough Bridge,

521
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,336
onto the FDR, and we're right
into the heart of Manhattan.

522
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,137
All right.

523
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,402
Is that New York City
back there?

524
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,471
What are you
talking about?

525
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,346
Oh, no, this is the
George Washington Bridge.

526
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,475
This map...

527
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,986
What do you mean, the map?

528
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:58,783
You think everything I do
is from reading the map?

529
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:05,255
Computer Voice:
Proceed down Grand Street.

530
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,796
"Proceed down
Grand Street. "

531
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,297
Oh, don't feel bad.

532
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:09,923
He's obviously
been here before.

533
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,524
He knows the city.

534
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,035
Well, I wouldn't have
been confused at all

535
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:14,832
if we'd come into the city
the right way.

536
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:17,738
Well, he is
not confused.

537
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,276
- Huh?
- What's that?

538
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,539
It's French.

539
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:23,875
Here, just press
this over here.

540
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,381
No, no, no, no,
don't press it.

541
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,781
Why, Henry?
I don't know droit.

542
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,687
Oh, no! What did he say?
What did he say?

543
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:34,417
It's Chinese or something.
Find Spanish. Just find Spanish.

544
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:35,822
No, what's he saying?

545
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:36,825
Find Spanish.

546
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:38,088
I can't find Spanish.

547
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,459
I don't know how
to work this thing.

548
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,965
I'll press...
I'll press that.

549
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,728
Henry, do something!

550
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,497
- Aah!
- Nancy, Nancy!

551
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,629
Turn! Turn! Turn!

552
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,706
Nancy, it's fish!

553
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,675
Oh, my God! God!

554
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:57,577
Aah!

555
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,582
Put on the brake!
The brake!

556
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,585
- Aah!
- Aah!

557
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:12,522
How's your nose,
honey?

558
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:14,029
It's tender
to the touch,

559
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:15,463
just like me.

560
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:16,794
What's the bill?

561
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,495
Oh, it's $2,200.

562
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,299
I could have bought
a car for that.

563
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:22,999
Oh, I know.

564
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:26,304
Oh, look at New York.

565
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,810
Where?

566
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:28,970
Honey, I want
to get to the hotel.

567
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:29,978
How do we get there?

568
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:30,979
That's very simple.

569
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:32,481
The streets
of New York

570
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,811
are laid out
on a rigid grid.

571
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:35,647
Yeah, like somebody
else I know.

572
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,084
You want to
get there or not?

573
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:40,317
Yes, I do. All right,
so we follow the rigid grid

574
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,325
to Park Avenue
and 64th Street.

575
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:44,486
But now, all right,
now wait, right now we're at...

576
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:46,324
No, don't look
around at the signs.

577
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:47,830
That's how people know
you're from out of town.

578
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,331
You don't want that, no.

579
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,095
And, by the way, there's
a walk New Yorkers have.

580
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:52,396
They never stroll.

581
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:53,663
They always look like
they have someplace,

582
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:54,829
you know, really
important to go to.

583
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:56,372
Ok.

584
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,873
It's gotta
be like, uh...

585
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,875
it's, uh...

586
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:03,504
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Henry.

587
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,604
You know, go ahead
and make fun, you know,

588
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,274
but you walk
like a tourist,

589
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,045
and that's how you
get in trouble.

590
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,547
I'm going to get
Eggs Benedict.

591
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,213
I'm going to have chicken,
mashed potatoes and gravy.

592
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,620
- That sounds good.
- I'm so hungry.

593
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,091
Excuse me. I'm terribly
sorry to disturb you.

594
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,923
I can't tell you how
embarrassing this is.

595
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,327
I just left all my money
and credit cards in a cab.

596
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:22,331
I'm late to a rehearsal.

597
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:23,991
I've got a play on Broadway
at the moment.

598
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,330
If I could borrow
$5.00 for a taxi,

599
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:26,630
you can come with me
to the theater.

600
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,636
I will pay you
back there.

601
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,899
You expect us
to believe this?

602
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,107
No. No, I suppose not. I'm
sorry to have bothered you.

603
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:34,109
What play?

604
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:35,702
Nancy,
there's no play.

605
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,303
Actually,
it's a revival

606
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:39,611
of Jesus Christ Superstar
at the Broadhurst Theater.

607
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:42,277
Do come if you
get the chance.

608
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:43,843
Wait a minute.
Jesus Christ Superstar?

609
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,411
Oh, my God. Are you
Andrew Lloyd Webber?

610
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,923
Yes... thank you. I...

611
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,982
Oh, honey, it's
Andrew Lloyd Webber!

612
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,925
We go into previews
next week, and as I said...

613
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:52,984
We love Jesus Christ
Superstar.

614
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,327
We saw
Phantom of the Opera.

615
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:56,730
And Evita.

616
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,358
- And Evita.
- That was so great.

617
00:23:58,435 --> 00:23:59,367
And Cats...

618
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:00,368
Ohhh...

619
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:02,302
Oh, honey,
that was just...

620
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,273
It hit so home
for us.

621
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,933
We lost a cat
that year.

622
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:07,943
It didn't sing
like your cats.

623
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,911
I'm Henry Clark, and
this is my wife Nancy.

624
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,141
A pleasure
to meet you both.

625
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:14,207
We'd be honored to
lend you anything.

626
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:15,546
Oh, no. Please.
You mustn't take out

627
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:16,847
an open wallet
in the city,

628
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,285
no matter how much the
crime rate's dropped.

629
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:20,289
Yeah, well, I...
I entered Yokelville.

630
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:22,291
Come on... Come over
here. Come on.

631
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,792
I am so embarrassed
about this.

632
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:25,886
No, don't be embarrassed.
When we tell the people in Ohio

633
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,157
that we lent
Andrew Lloyd Webber 5...

634
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:30,663
- Sir. Sir...
- No, it's Lord.

635
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,668
I think he's a lord.
Sir Lord.

636
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:33,998
Sir Lord. You know
Paul McCartney?

637
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,231
All right, shut up.

638
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:36,294
What's he like?
Is he, like, fun...

639
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:37,738
Shut up. Shut up!

640
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:38,832
What? Jesus!

641
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:40,934
Give me...
Give it to me!

642
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:42,342
Give me the bag.

643
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,744
Give me the bag.
Give me...

644
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:44,746
Give him the bag!

645
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:46,976
Hey... Oh, my God!

646
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,143
Ohh! Why are you
doing this?

647
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:52,552
Every show you do
is a hit!

648
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,090
- Henry: Hey!
- Henry!

649
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:55,819
Henry, Andrew Lloyd Webber
just stole my pocketbook!

650
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,485
He's not
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

651
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,290
He's just
a common criminal.

652
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,297
Oh, Henry. I have
jelly legs, honey!

653
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:02,730
Come on. Let's
get outta here.

654
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,392
What are we
gonna do, Henry?

655
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:06,026
Here. Here.
Ok. Ok, watch.

656
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:07,536
What are you
doing, Henry?

657
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:09,037
Credit card.
I put it in my sock

658
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:10,539
when we were
on the plane.

659
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:11,699
Oh! You're
a genius!

660
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:12,867
Thank you,
thank you.

661
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:14,535
My God!
You're a genius!

662
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:17,415
Put it away! We might run
into Stephen Sondheim.

663
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,289
Hello.

664
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,859
Ohhh...

665
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:38,594
Oh, thank God.

666
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,601
Look!

667
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,762
Look at this place.

668
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,271
Oh, it's beautiful.

669
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,273
Oh, it's good
to be inside.

670
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:45,774
Michelle, is that
a new haircut?

671
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:46,935
Yes, it is.

672
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:48,638
I think you'd better
stay in the back

673
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,202
for a while.

674
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:53,315
Good evening. Welcome
to the Grand Mark Hotel.

675
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,318
How may I be
of service to you?

676
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,081
We have a reservation.
Clark.

677
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,850
My name is Mersault, the
manager of the hotel.

678
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,858
Yes, here we are.
Mr. And Mrs. Clark.

679
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:03,757
If there's anything
at all I can do

680
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,261
to make your stay
more pleasant,

681
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:06,887
please don't hesitate
to let me know.

682
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:07,896
That would be
room service.

683
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,592
We haven't eaten
since this morning.

684
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:10,929
Oh, we're starving.

685
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:11,933
I will send a complimentary
basket of fruit and cheese

686
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:12,991
up to your room immediately,

687
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,833
along, perhaps,
with a fine merlot?

688
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:16,065
Oh, yummy.

689
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,539
If I could
just have an imprint

690
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:18,575
of your credit card?

691
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:22,100
And then we'll have you
up to your...

692
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,945
to... uh, to your room...
in a jiffy.

693
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,074
You wouldn't believe
what we've been through.

694
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:28,413
First our flight
was rerouted.

695
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,919
Then they sent us
to Boston.

696
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:31,420
And then when
we finally got here,

697
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,354
we were mugged
by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

698
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:34,857
How extraordinary.
Well, I'll certainly

699
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,859
mention it next time
he stays with us.

700
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,861
Perhaps he's under some
strain at the moment.

701
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:40,260
Ah. We have
a message for you.

702
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,625
"We have located
your luggage.

703
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:45,691
"Thanks again
to Mrs. Clark

704
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:46,758
"for the lovely sketch.

705
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:48,168
"We will deliver
to the hotel

706
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,365
later this evening. "

707
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,998
Oh, they're
so sweet, honey.

708
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:52,007
Oh, God.

709
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:53,668
At last,
some good news.

710
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,837
Um, I'm afraid
we seem to have

711
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:58,074
a little problem
with your credit card.

712
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,740
What kind
of problem?

713
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:03,082
A financial one. Would you
care to speak to them?

714
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:05,553
Yes?
This is Hen...

715
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:08,390
This is Henry Clark.

716
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,551
I've never had a problem
with my credit card.

717
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,687
Have I ever had a problem
with my credit card?

718
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,253
I don't know who you had
a problem with, Henry.

719
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:15,764
No, I never
purchased anything

720
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,494
at Uncle's Stereo
in Manhattan.

721
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,332
$800 at Sofas You Love?

722
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:25,239
Susan Clark.
Yes, she's my daughter.

723
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,174
She's how much overdue?

724
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,112
I understand.

725
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:32,580
Thank you.

726
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:35,242
Nancy. Nancy. Na...

727
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,843
You won't believe this.

728
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,116
Susan has stolen
one of our credit cards.

729
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:40,315
What are you
doing, Henry?

730
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:43,827
I'm going to call her so
I can scream at someone.

731
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,156
The battery's dead.

732
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:46,958
May I borrow
your phone?

733
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:50,432
Uh, there's a pay phone
on Lexington and 64th.

734
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,435
Henry. Henry, I'm gonna
tell you something,

735
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:55,028
but I want you to
promise not to lose it.

736
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,538
See, she couldn't stay
in the med school dorms

737
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,040
because that was just
for enrolled students,

738
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,541
and she was looking
for an apartment

739
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,043
once she decided that
she was gonna drop out

740
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,544
and become an actress,

741
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,308
and that's why I gave her
the credit card.

742
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:05,678
So don't be mad at her,
Henry. Be mad at me.

743
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,512
How about if I'm mad
at both of you?

744
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,052
I was just trying
to protect you.

745
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,086
Don't try
and protect me.

746
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,519
Susan has dropped out
of med school,

747
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,556
and you didn't tell me?

748
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:15,217
No, because
when I tell you...

749
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,157
Sorry to interrupt,

750
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:19,457
but as the credit card company
won't honor the charges,

751
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,293
I'm afraid I'm unable
to offer you a room,

752
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:24,027
but do please come back
when you have some money.

753
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,762
Oh... please?

754
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,770
Can't you
just trust us?

755
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:32,367
Are you
throwing us out?

756
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:35,935
Good heavens, no. No, no.
Security will do that.

757
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:37,808
Oh, I don't
believe this.

758
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:40,949
What do we do now?

759
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,280
We're going
to Susan's.

760
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,615
No. Thank you.

761
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:44,779
Henry, it's her life.

762
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,288
It took a lot of courage
to drop out.

763
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,291
It's easy to be courageous
with Daddy's credit card.

764
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,587
Well, it's her passion.

765
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,888
Don't you understand
passion?

766
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,792
Hey, I'm filled with passion.
When I was her age,

767
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:54,296
I wanted
to be a writer,

768
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,798
and my father
practically went berserk.

769
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,800
Well, isn't this
the same situation?

770
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:59,802
No, because I went to him,
and I discussed it with him.

771
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,804
Well, then we're
going to Susan's,

772
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:03,737
and we're gonna
discuss it with her.

773
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:05,741
Call me crazy, but
somehow I'm not in the mood

774
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,004
to see her new furniture
right now.

775
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,511
Eventually
you're gonna have to

776
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,013
work this out
with her, Henry.

777
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,514
I'm supposed to work it
out with her?

778
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,517
After she throws away
$50,000 in tuition money

779
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,711
without even
consulting me?

780
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,754
Maybe that's the way they
do it in bizarro world,

781
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:18,913
but not in Ohio.

782
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,923
This is not Ohio,
Henry. It's New York.

783
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:23,084
And we're hungry
and homeless,

784
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,594
which is exactly what
my parents said I'd be

785
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,255
if I married you.
I'm going!

786
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,974
What am I
supposed to do?

787
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,905
All right. I'll follow you
till you get there,

788
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:47,416
but then I'm leaving!

789
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:51,787
I don't know why you're
being so judgmental, Henry.

790
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:53,789
I mean, she might be
a wonderful actress.

791
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:55,791
And you'd actually
be very proud of her now

792
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:56,951
because she's writing.

793
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm glad you
told me that.

794
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,463
I was worried there
for a minute,

795
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:02,556
but if she's going
to act and write...

796
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,294
Let's see. 1...

797
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,235
Oh, here it is.
148.

798
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:11,807
Here it is.
Clark-Guerrero.

799
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:12,807
Who's Guerrero?

800
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,138
I don't know.

801
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,145
You don't know,
or you're not telling me?

802
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,305
Because we've established
there's a difference.

803
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:20,280
Where is she?

804
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,318
Probably stuck
in her new sofa.

805
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,824
Henry,
come on. Let's go.

806
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:31,326
I'm just gonna stay outside
here and be difficult.

807
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,680
Go for it.
Come on, come on.

808
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:22,811
Susan?

809
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,577
I'll write her
a little note.

810
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,088
Don't you touch
our paper.

811
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,321
I was just taking a little
sliver off the paper.

812
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,090
I was gonna write a note to
my daughter. She lives in 2-B.

813
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,029
We don't know
the girl in 2-B.

814
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,329
Oh, she just moved in.
I'm her mother.

815
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,130
- Ask her if she has I.D.
- Do you have I.D.?

816
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,295
No, I don't have I.D.

817
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:48,531
- Ask her if she has a key.
- Do you have a key?

818
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:49,697
I don't have a key.

819
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,400
- Ask how she got in here.
- How'd you get in?

820
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,908
Ask her to stop
asking me questions.

821
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:54,967
I don't have to answer any
of this. I'm getting out.

822
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,013
Don't let her go.

823
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,911
Hold the lunatics'
convention somewhere else,

824
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:00,779
please?
I'm working here.

825
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,284
She was stealing
our paper!

826
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:03,478
I came to see
my daughter in 2-B.

827
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,816
What's the matter
with you?

828
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:05,820
Susan?

829
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,083
Sweet girl.

830
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:09,022
You know Susan...

831
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:11,390
professionally?

832
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,952
I hope not, because
this is a sick woman.

833
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:17,865
Hey! You break
that rack, you buy it!

834
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,800
It was really nice getting
to know all of you.

835
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,962
You're not
going anywhere

836
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:22,130
till the cops
get here.

837
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,639
Don't make me
set Corky on you.

838
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:26,141
Look, I'm really tired
of this repartee.

839
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,974
And if you think that
I'm afraid of your dog,

840
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:32,675
Well, ha, ha!
Hoo, hoo!

841
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:35,650
Aah!

842
00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:41,613
You make an excellent point.

843
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:43,125
She wasn't home!

844
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:44,251
No, no. I...

845
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:48,363
Nancy?

846
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:50,457
Oh, my God!

847
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,297
Nancy!

848
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:54,030
I am bustin'
my butt...

849
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:55,662
Hey!

850
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,570
Nancy!

851
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,734
Ohh! Throw it!

852
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,742
Ohh!

853
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,640
Ohh! Ohh!

854
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,978
Aah! Ohh! Aah!

855
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,747
Oh, good hands, babe.

856
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,049
All right, honey!

857
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:13,146
Ok!

858
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:16,420
All they care about
is food...

859
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,894
Ohh! Ohh! This way!
This way!

860
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:21,021
In there!

861
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,125
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

862
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,634
Oh, honey!

863
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,193
Incoming.

864
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:30,471
Croissants.

865
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,472
Bear claws.

866
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,473
Sticky buns.

867
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:33,839
Let's go.

868
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,813
Oh, oh, oh. Um,

869
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,816
there's no eating
before the meeting.

870
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:41,816
Meeting?

871
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:43,819
Nice to see
some new faces.

872
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:45,821
Sorry I'm late.
It's a great group.

873
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,857
Sit right down.
Let's begin.

874
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:55,322
First of all, I'd like
to welcome our new members.

875
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:57,059
If you could
introduce yourselves...

876
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,067
Uh... my name
is Nancy,

877
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:01,603
and this is
my husband Henry.

878
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:03,935
All: Hi, Nancy and Henry.

879
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,770
Hello.

880
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:09,573
Welcome. Last week, we were
discussing Edward's problem.

881
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:10,772
Edward?

882
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:11,779
It's ok.

883
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,285
I'd like to start off
by letting everyone know

884
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,878
how much your support
has meant to me.

885
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:21,116
As you know,
I've been masturbating

886
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,091
up to 17 times a day.

887
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,956
Nancy, we
have to go.

888
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:26,086
Henry, Nancy,

889
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:29,495
you're giving Edward
a very negative message.

890
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:31,693
- Yeah?
- Sit down, please.

891
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,305
We don't want to send
a negative message.

892
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,635
Not too close.

893
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:41,433
So, Edward, how was
last week for you?

894
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,480
It's been really wonderful,
thank you. Uh...

895
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:46,481
I've been concentrating
on translating

896
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:50,315
the sexual impulse into
other forms of expression.

897
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:53,413
Uh, working out regularly,
going to movies,

898
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,422
calling friends.

899
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,425
Trying to integrate
the urge

900
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:58,688
into a more well-rounded
lifestyle.

901
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,498
That's about all.

902
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:11,471
Sheena, what about you?
Were you able to cut down

903
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:14,601
on your number of random sexual
encounters during the week?

904
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,872
Well, I've had the flu,
so just my doctor.

905
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:19,938
Ah. Single digits.
That's great. Ok,

906
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:22,075
let's hear
from the new people.

907
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,414
What about
you folks?

908
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:24,919
Actually, we just got
in here by mistake.

909
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:26,785
We really came in
to worship,

910
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,448
and this is
the wrong denomination.

911
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:30,516
My husband is right.
I mean,

912
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:32,561
actually, we don't really
even have sex that much.

913
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:33,561
- Nancy!
- Hmm?

914
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,326
Oh, so your problem
is lack of sex.

915
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,661
Tell us more.

916
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,668
You know something?
We're from Ohio,

917
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:41,670
and we really don't
discuss sex in public.

918
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,467
It's sort of
our state motto.

919
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:46,875
Well, actually, um...
that's part of the problem,

920
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:48,501
is that
we don't discuss it.

921
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:50,011
Nancy,
we're from Ohio.

922
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,378
But we don't even really
do it very much anymore.

923
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,474
And when you do,
it's probably programmed

924
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:56,610
and lacking
in spontaneity.

925
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:57,778
Exactly.
It's like, um...

926
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:59,287
It's like we're
2 dead people.

927
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,287
Nancy!

928
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:01,288
Ohio!

929
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:02,984
So it's not so much

930
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:04,321
the declining frequency

931
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:06,385
as the fact that you've
both come to accept

932
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,397
this lack of physical
and emotional intimacy.

933
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,899
This is boring.
If this keeps up,

934
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,162
I'm gonna sleep
with somebody right now.

935
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,171
Have you tried tying
each other up with bamboo?

936
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,672
No. Actually,
we use the club.

937
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,004
Oh. The time.
Well, ok.

938
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:21,873
Henry, discussing it

939
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,845
is the first step toward
solving the problem.

940
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:25,847
You know what?
I don't have a problem.

941
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:29,214
I mean, I enjoy sex as much
as the next guy. Euhh.

942
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:30,718
Henry, let's face it.

943
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:32,584
We haven't done it
in over 2 months.

944
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:38,227
Henry, clearly,
you have a problem.

945
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:42,358
Well, ok. I've been
a little tense lately.

946
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:43,558
What have you
been tense about?

947
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,999
What have I been
tense about?

948
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,468
- Yeah.
- Let's just say I've been tense.

949
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:49,368
Well, why
have you been tense?

950
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,872
Why have I been tense?
Why have I been tense?

951
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,305
I don't know.

952
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,774
Like, I don't have
the right to be tense?

953
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:56,471
Henry, would you like
to share with the group

954
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:58,480
the reason
why you feel tense?

955
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:01,108
Yes. I'd love to share
this with the group.

956
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:07,249
I was fired.

957
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:09,553
I got fired!

958
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,059
- You what?
- I got fired.

959
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,389
You were fired?

960
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:13,895
This is the only interview
I could get

961
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:15,294
'cause I'm 106 years old,
and...

962
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,889
How could you
not tell me?!

963
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,900
I was gonna here here alone.
I was gonna get this job.

964
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:21,232
You came with me. I had to lie
to you to keep it from you,

965
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:22,999
and it just creates
more tension!

966
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,835
I would love to
sleep with you, Henry.

967
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:29,402
I find failure very erotic.
Or success. Doesn't matter.

968
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,242
Oh... shut up,
Sheena!

969
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:34,379
Ohhh...

970
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,941
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry that, uh,
that we ruined your meeting,

971
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,183
and I hope that you can all,
uh, stop having sex.

972
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:42,291
You were fired?

973
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:43,791
I don't believe it!

974
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,953
Not only do I hear it
for the first time,

975
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:48,793
but I hear it in front
of a bunch of perverts?

976
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,799
Oh, God! How
could you not tell me?

977
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,801
Hey, you lied to me
about Susan.

978
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,461
It wasn't
really a lie.

979
00:37:54,537 --> 00:37:56,334
It was an incremental
accumulation of half truths.

980
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:59,398
Oh, really. Well, then
mine wasn't a lie, either. It was spin.

981
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,273
Did it ever occur to you
that I could've helped you?

982
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,006
We were partners.
We worked together.

983
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,605
I know a little bit
about advertising.

984
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,977
I... I couldn't tell you.
I was ashamed.

985
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,113
The only thing you have
to be ashamed of, Henry,

986
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:14,451
is not telling me.

987
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,185
If we can't be
honest with each other,

988
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:17,886
what kind of marriage
do we have?

989
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:19,929
I guess it's the kind where
I don't tell you I was fired

990
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:21,429
and you don't tell me

991
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:22,930
our daughter's been
embezzling from us.

992
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,159
It's very common.

993
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,168
So what did
Sellinski do,

994
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:29,137
just let you go
after 23 years?

995
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,673
They're letting
all the older guys

996
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:32,935
run out their contracts.

997
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,271
Apparently,
if you're over 40,

998
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,777
you're not
cutting-edge anymore.

999
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:38,780
Well, that's ridiculous.
You were never cutting-edge.

1000
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,281
That's what I told them.

1001
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,783
All right, we're gonna
forget about Sellinski.

1002
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,682
We're gonna
forget about them,

1003
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,482
and this is
a whole new start for you.

1004
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:46,544
I'm not getting this job.

1005
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,183
Not without a shave
and a clean suit

1006
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:50,851
and a good night's sleep.
By tomorrow morning,

1007
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,087
I'm gonna look
like Keith Richards.

1008
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:54,595
Henry, now's not
the time to give up.

1009
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:55,688
I'm not giving up.

1010
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,528
Giving up is when you
can still get the job

1011
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,693
and you give up. I
don't have that option.

1012
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,600
I wish I could give up.

1013
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:03,536
Henry, Henry,
you know what this is?

1014
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:04,903
What is it?

1015
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:08,410
It's a test. Here we are
in the middle of our lives,

1016
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,412
and we have
a decision to make.

1017
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,414
Are we on a...
a slow march toward death,

1018
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,814
or are we gonna
embrace life?

1019
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,374
Slow march toward death?

1020
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:19,580
No! Embrace life!

1021
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:23,217
I want to live!
I want to feel useful!

1022
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:24,885
I want to explore
and experience!

1023
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:29,261
I... I want to suck the marrow
out of life, Henry!

1024
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:30,731
What do you want?

1025
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,928
Well, I... I definitely want
to do some marrow-sucking.

1026
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:35,937
Uh, but otherwise,
I think I...

1027
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:38,439
I just want to catch up
on my reading...

1028
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:42,103
and, you know, fix those
kitchen cabinets that are broken.

1029
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:44,112
That's it? That's all you want to do

1030
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,114
is just sit home
fixing things and reading

1031
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,275
for the rest
of your life?

1032
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:51,787
'Cause I don't know how
I fit into that plan, Henry.

1033
00:39:51,854 --> 00:39:54,254
All you need is
a good light and a hammer.

1034
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:58,018
Maybe we have
different plans.

1035
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:00,619
Oh, come on, Henry.

1036
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:02,392
Come on, think.

1037
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:05,229
Think, honey.
There must be something.

1038
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:07,801
Well...

1039
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,802
um...

1040
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:10,805
I'd like to get
some food. I'm hungry.

1041
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:12,807
And, you know, uh...
we don't have any bags.

1042
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,809
We don't have any money,
so that's a...

1043
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:16,640
Bags! Oh! Henry!

1044
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:18,647
The bags! Remember?
When we went to Freeport?

1045
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:20,307
We can't eat
the bags.

1046
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,816
I know we can't
eat the bags.

1047
00:40:21,884 --> 00:40:23,818
Remember when we went
to Freeport and you told me

1048
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:25,820
to put the travelers' checks
inside the bag?

1049
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:28,186
They're in the bag! Let's go
back to the hotel and find them.

1050
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,690
You left them
in the bag?

1051
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,192
I left them
in the bag.

1052
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,352
You left... how much?

1053
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:33,520
- $600.
- $600?

1054
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:35,530
It's not earning interest
when it's in the bag.

1055
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:38,167
Oh, stop it.

1056
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:41,830
Here he is.

1057
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,268
We're back.

1058
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,138
Mr. And Mrs. Clark,
the sequel.

1059
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,438
Did our luggage
get here yet?

1060
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:50,944
I'm afraid not,
but I'll let you know

1061
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:52,947
the moment it arrives,
if you care to write the name

1062
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:54,482
of your hostel there.

1063
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,676
Very funny.

1064
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,651
But how very nice
to see you!

1065
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,187
Oh... thank you. You know,
it's so nice to...

1066
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:01,517
How was Monte Carlo?

1067
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,455
Oh, it would
not stop raining.

1068
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:04,924
Damn the French!

1069
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:06,255
The doorman at the curb

1070
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:07,693
did not help Mrs. Wellstone
out of the car.

1071
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:08,787
Damn the doorman.

1072
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,297
He was helping some large,
unfortunate woman

1073
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:11,627
with a crated animal.

1074
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,327
They should've
both been crated.

1075
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:14,494
Good point.

1076
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,231
I'll have all three of them
removed immediately.

1077
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:17,636
Now, that is the kind
of service I expect.

1078
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:20,641
And that's
the kind of service

1079
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:22,142
you shall receive,
Mr. Wellstone,

1080
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:23,473
as long as
I'm aboveground.

1081
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:25,445
Mrs. Wellstone: Maybe you two
should get a room together.

1082
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:27,505
Mersault:
I'm here to serve.

1083
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,743
You and me both.

1084
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:31,308
Now, is there anything
at all that I can get you?

1085
00:41:31,386 --> 00:41:35,015
Just make sure that it
doesn't rain while we're here.

1086
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,250
I'll speak
to housekeeping.

1087
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:40,159
And, um, Mrs. Wellstone,
I just love those shoes.

1088
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,992
Don't break my heart

1089
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,658
and tell me they're
not real leopard.

1090
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:45,859
Mmm, hmm.

1091
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:47,333
Ha ha ha ha!

1092
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:48,835
Come on, come on.

1093
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:50,531
Mr. Wellstone:
Off we go.

1094
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:58,838
Henry, look!

1095
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:01,246
I don't want
to get you too excited,

1096
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:02,908
but I think
they have trail mix.

1097
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,247
Buffet time,
honey.

1098
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,617
I'm gonna find a bathroom.
Order me a peanut.

1099
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:13,885
Thank you.

1100
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:16,388
Ohhh...

1101
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:21,134
Mmm.

1102
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:26,402
Special diet?

1103
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:28,534
Mm-hmm.

1104
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:32,304
Could I get you something
to drink with that?

1105
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:34,144
Oh, no, thank you.
I wouldn't want to impose.

1106
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:35,410
Oh, no imposition.

1107
00:42:35,484 --> 00:42:37,111
Are you sure
I couldn't get you...

1108
00:42:37,185 --> 00:42:38,117
Champagne.

1109
00:42:38,186 --> 00:42:40,416
Champagne
for the lady.

1110
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,820
Thank you.

1111
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,451
Can I have some
of those cherries, please?

1112
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:46,926
Sure.

1113
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:48,792
No, the whole thing.
The whole thing.

1114
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:50,491
Thank you.

1115
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:51,497
Mm-hmm.

1116
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:53,500
Mmm. Oh,
thank you.

1117
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:56,503
Hi. I'm... I'm Greg.
I'm here from L.A.

1118
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:58,004
I'm an agent.

1119
00:42:58,073 --> 00:42:59,506
I'm on my way
down to the Village

1120
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:01,007
to check out
this new Irish playwright

1121
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:02,771
for a sitcom
that I packaged.

1122
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:04,277
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

1123
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:06,337
Actually, I've got
an extra ticket,

1124
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:09,646
and I do have a limo...
if you'd be interested.

1125
00:43:12,187 --> 00:43:14,121
Are you staying
in the hotel, Greg?

1126
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:16,123
Yes. Suite.
14th floor.

1127
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:19,092
Mmm. Are you alone?

1128
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,323
Just me and
my expense account.

1129
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:25,165
You're funny, Greg.

1130
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:26,723
Hey, baby,
how's it goin'?

1131
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:30,363
Oh, shut up.
What are you, 106?

1132
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,532
Let's move
to a table.

1133
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:34,472
It won't be so noisy.

1134
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:36,602
Ok. Yeah, sure.

1135
00:43:47,556 --> 00:43:48,488
Well.

1136
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:50,787
So... do you
come here often?

1137
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:53,123
Only when my husband
works late.

1138
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:54,924
You're married. I'm sorry.
I never would've...

1139
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:58,796
No. Uh, actually, I think
my husband's having an affair.

1140
00:43:58,867 --> 00:43:59,799
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1141
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:01,199
Really.

1142
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:03,169
In fact, I wish he'd
stay out more often.

1143
00:44:03,238 --> 00:44:04,500
You know. Yeah.

1144
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:07,304
Look, I don't
want to seem

1145
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:08,809
like one of those
successful guys

1146
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:10,811
that blows in
from the West Coast

1147
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,312
for a few meetings
and a good time,

1148
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,110
but if you wanted to
get together anytime...

1149
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:16,707
Give me the key
to your room, Greg.

1150
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:18,953
What?

1151
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,954
Oh, come on. Let's not
play games, Greg.

1152
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:22,956
You know what
we're talking about.

1153
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:24,787
Ha ha! I was wondering

1154
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,385
if I might speak
with you for a moment?

1155
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:29,362
No! Creep.

1156
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:31,365
I am trying to
have a conversation

1157
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:32,365
with this gentleman.
Ok?

1158
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:33,366
Please stop
harassing me,

1159
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:35,596
or I'm gonna call
the manager.

1160
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,264
Now, go away.
Just go!

1161
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:40,466
Oh!

1162
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:41,474
That's sick.

1163
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:42,635
Yeah, I know.

1164
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:43,643
A guy that age
trying to pick up

1165
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:44,644
someone like you.

1166
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:46,305
I have to leave.

1167
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:48,975
My adult diapers
are bunching up.

1168
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,483
He just doesn't
want to leave.

1169
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:52,486
He's in here every night.
He's chatting me up.

1170
00:44:52,554 --> 00:44:54,488
It's, like, you know...
It's pathetic.

1171
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:55,488
Yes.

1172
00:44:55,557 --> 00:44:57,320
- So, Greg...
- Mmm?

1173
00:44:57,392 --> 00:45:00,327
Is what I think gonna
happen gonna happen?

1174
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:01,987
Mmm? 'Cause if it is,

1175
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:04,793
you're in for the wildest
night of your life.

1176
00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:06,766
I'll be back
around 10:00, 10:30.

1177
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:07,767
Is that good?

1178
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:09,895
I'll be waiting
in your room.

1179
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:15,438
I don't know.
Um...

1180
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,307
You don't know?

1181
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:18,778
No. No, I don't.

1182
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:21,213
Mmm. Too bad, Greg.

1183
00:45:24,352 --> 00:45:27,378
Because you don't know
what you'll be missing.

1184
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:31,458
Hey. Hey, look, look.
Wait. Ahem.

1185
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:33,790
My room number's
1402, ok?

1186
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:36,296
And I'll see you there
around 10:00, 10:30?

1187
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:38,059
But hang on. I don't
even know your name.

1188
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,225
What's your name?

1189
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:43,462
Mrs. Robinson.

1190
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:44,664
That's sexy.

1191
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:45,671
Hey.

1192
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,674
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Robinson.

1193
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:49,039
See you later.

1194
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:58,979
We'll have the lobster,
the grilled salmon,

1195
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:01,352
and the creme brulée,
please.

1196
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:03,288
And could you throw in
a couple of steaks?

1197
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:04,791
No dressing
on the salad,

1198
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,794
and we need this
as soon as possible.

1199
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:08,295
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

1200
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:10,797
You were really something
at the bar tonight.

1201
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:13,801
Oh, Henry, we are
going to have

1202
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,803
the best meal
of all time!

1203
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,304
I barely
recognized you.

1204
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:19,340
You were so animalistic.
You were so hedonistic.

1205
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:20,431
You were so... naughty...

1206
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:21,601
Oh, you're so sweet,
honey.

1207
00:46:21,676 --> 00:46:22,608
Fries! Henry,

1208
00:46:22,677 --> 00:46:24,269
we didn't order
any fries!

1209
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:26,371
Like you were some
cheap, tawdry sex machine.

1210
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:28,382
- Oh!
- Oh!

1211
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,382
Mrs. Robinson?

1212
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:32,443
Mrs. Robinson.
You in there?

1213
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:33,453
Hello.

1214
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:35,683
It's your agent.
I want to see you.

1215
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:37,657
Uh, I'll be right there...

1216
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:40,058
What's his name? Greg!

1217
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:41,561
All right.
But I'm timing you

1218
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,224
on a very expensive
watch.

1219
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:46,028
Honey,
you have to hide.

1220
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:47,398
I will not hide!

1221
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:48,993
But this is his room!

1222
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,002
I am your husband!

1223
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,163
Greg: Come on!

1224
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:52,900
All right, all right,
where? Here!

1225
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:56,909
Here. Just get... Just
scoot under the bed!

1226
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:58,411
It's too small!

1227
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,471
Get something
to camouflage...

1228
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:02,380
Uhh! Ooh!

1229
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:04,650
Mrs. Robinson.

1230
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,653
Cut it...
Can you see me?

1231
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:08,086
Yes, I... Shh!

1232
00:47:08,156 --> 00:47:09,555
Pull me out.
I'm stuck.

1233
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:11,057
30 seconds!

1234
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:13,026
Unh! Unh! Unh!

1235
00:47:15,263 --> 00:47:16,696
Ok. All right.

1236
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:18,699
All right.
All right.

1237
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,758
Don't you let him...
You know, and... and...

1238
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:22,427
And whatever you...
Don't... Don't you...

1239
00:47:22,504 --> 00:47:25,371
Honey, I won't!
Just shut up!

1240
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:29,601
Hi.

1241
00:47:29,678 --> 00:47:31,339
I was wondering if
you'd still be here.

1242
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,108
Oh, well, w-why
wouldn't I be?

1243
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:35,081
I don't know.
Some women might find

1244
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,243
this kind of scenario
a little intimidating.

1245
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:38,752
I don't find this
scenario intimidating.

1246
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,754
I find it kind of,
um, dangerous

1247
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:41,914
in an erotic sense.

1248
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,116
Oh...

1249
00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:44,590
Ha ha ha!

1250
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:46,388
I love the way
you put words together.

1251
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:48,395
Well, I've always been
good with my mouth.

1252
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:50,090
Oh. Well.

1253
00:47:50,165 --> 00:47:51,757
Uh... oh.

1254
00:47:55,837 --> 00:47:56,804
Oh, my lucky day.

1255
00:47:56,871 --> 00:47:58,463
Ohh!

1256
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,167
Ooh! Uh, ha ha ha!

1257
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,141
I didn't expect to
see you back so soon.

1258
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,075
Uh, I forgot
my cell phone.

1259
00:48:04,145 --> 00:48:05,077
You did?

1260
00:48:05,146 --> 00:48:06,078
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1261
00:48:06,147 --> 00:48:07,239
Can't be without it.

1262
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:09,749
Right. You must be
a very important person.

1263
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,945
Maybe later I'll show you
my phone list.

1264
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,214
Oh, really? Ooh!

1265
00:48:13,288 --> 00:48:15,586
Ooh, you like that?
I didn't do anything.

1266
00:48:15,657 --> 00:48:17,147
- Oh. Really?
- No.

1267
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:18,658
How about a little sample
before I go?

1268
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,661
All good things happen
to those who wait.

1269
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:21,661
Oh, really?

1270
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,163
Yeah. And I have
a really, really

1271
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:25,333
big surprise for you
when you get back.

1272
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:26,660
Yeah?
Give me a hint.

1273
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:28,167
Well, you better bring
a fire extinguisher.

1274
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:29,497
Oh, Mrs. Robinson!

1275
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,003
Ohh! Oh, no,
don't start now.

1276
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:33,267
Don't start now. If you do,
I'll never stop.

1277
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:38,671
- Hey ya.
- Hi.

1278
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:41,078
"Don't start. I won't
be able to stop"?!

1279
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:43,275
Well, I had to think
of something, Henry!

1280
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:45,785
Excuse me.
Who's that for?

1281
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,946
1402.

1282
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:49,489
I'm 1402.

1283
00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:51,115
You know what I think? I think
you're enjoying this.

1284
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:52,124
Well, maybe I am.

1285
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:53,319
I knew it!

1286
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:56,295
You know me. When I'm
hungry, I'll seduce anyone.

1287
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:58,525
Oh, that's comforting.

1288
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,760
Did you
order this?!

1289
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:03,561
What's he doing here?

1290
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:05,400
Uh...
he's my husband.

1291
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:07,202
Uh, Mr. Robinson.

1292
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:09,208
And how dare you try
to seduce my wife!

1293
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:10,300
She's twice your age!

1294
00:49:10,378 --> 00:49:11,470
Henry!

1295
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:13,570
Is this for 3? I only
have settings for 2.

1296
00:49:13,647 --> 00:49:15,808
Are you crazy?
I'm not paying for this!

1297
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:17,009
I'll have to call
the manager.

1298
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:18,346
I'm gonna call
the police.

1299
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:19,716
Ohhh! Oh!

1300
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:21,277
Hey! Hey!

1301
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:22,617
Hey! Hey, hey!

1302
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,158
Go! Go! Come on!
Get Security!

1303
00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:30,255
Henry, we're in trouble.
What are we gonna do?

1304
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:31,764
Calm down. This can't
be the first time

1305
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:33,561
someone seduced a guest
to get his keys

1306
00:49:33,634 --> 00:49:36,501
so they could order a free meal
and have sex in his suite.

1307
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:39,965
Be careful.

1308
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:42,040
- Shit!
- Oh!

1309
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,440
Henry!

1310
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:51,644
Henry, come over here.

1311
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:55,716
Ohhh!

1312
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,485
Ohh!

1313
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:59,924
Henry, look, that door's
open down there.

1314
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:01,518
I think we can make it
to the balcony.

1315
00:50:01,595 --> 00:50:03,426
I think we can make
it to the street.

1316
00:50:03,497 --> 00:50:05,431
We just have to
climb down the sign.

1317
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:06,898
Are you insane?

1318
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:09,094
Henry. Henry.

1319
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,102
Watch.

1320
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:12,401
Nancy! Nancy,
Nancy, Nancy!

1321
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:13,531
Nancy,
what are you doing?

1322
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:15,006
You're gonna
kill yourself!

1323
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:19,345
I'm telling you,
they were in that room

1324
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:20,675
not 2 minutes ago.

1325
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:22,147
This woman shows up,
begs to be let inside.

1326
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:23,911
I'm not
the type of guy

1327
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:25,576
that's gonna
turn someone away.

1328
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:27,245
Ohh... ohhh!

1329
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:28,379
Nancy!

1330
00:50:28,456 --> 00:50:30,424
Uhh! Aah! Ohh!

1331
00:50:30,491 --> 00:50:32,482
Ohh!

1332
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:44,760
Nancy, I'm gonna have you
checked for testicles.

1333
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:47,330
If anything is gone from
my room, I am suing,

1334
00:50:47,408 --> 00:50:48,841
and no one from L.A.

1335
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:50,376
Will ever stay
in this hotel again!

1336
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:52,036
Come on, Henry!

1337
00:50:52,112 --> 00:50:53,545
You can do it,
honey!

1338
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:55,013
Yeah, ok.

1339
00:50:55,082 --> 00:50:57,550
Oh, baby, oh, baby...

1340
00:50:57,618 --> 00:50:58,710
Step by step.

1341
00:50:58,786 --> 00:51:00,219
Greg: Who knows what
they did in here.

1342
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:01,914
Look, I'm telling you
the truth!

1343
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:02,921
I think I'd know

1344
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,618
if I was trying
to seduce someone, ok?

1345
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,627
Mr. Allred, would you
sign this, please?

1346
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,755
Greg: Can I ask you a question?
What is it like to be so stupid?

1347
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:12,958
Come on, sweetie.
Don't be scared.

1348
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:15,501
I can do it.
I do this all the time.

1349
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:19,232
Hold on, Henry.
I'll be right back.

1350
00:51:19,306 --> 00:51:21,240
What?! Where...
Where you going?

1351
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:23,799
<i>Yeah</i>

1352
00:51:23,878 --> 00:51:26,576
<i>Bad girl</i>

1353
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:28,638
<i>Talkin' 'bout
the sad girl</i>

1354
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:29,648
<i>Sad girl</i>

1355
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:31,275
<i>Yeah</i>

1356
00:51:31,352 --> 00:51:33,149
<i>A sad girl</i>

1357
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,346
<i>Sad girl</i>

1358
00:51:34,421 --> 00:51:38,619
<i>Talking about
a bad, bad girl, yeah</i>

1359
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:44,053
<i>Now, don't you
ask yourself</i>

1360
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:47,996
<i>Who they are</i>

1361
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,161
<i>Like everybody else</i>

1362
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:54,332
<i>They wanna be a</i>

1363
00:51:54,408 --> 00:51:55,602
<i>Star</i>

1364
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:57,007
Whoo!

1365
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:01,843
Oh, my God! Henry,
Mersault is dancing

1366
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,645
in ladies' clothes
to Bad Girls.

1367
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,651
I don't think I can
get into heaven

1368
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:07,687
if that's the last thing
I see before I die.

1369
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:09,222
Ok, hurry up.
You gotta see this.

1370
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,155
Ok. Here I come.
Aah! Aah!

1371
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:13,159
Oh, Nancy! Oh, Nancy!
Oh, Nancy!

1372
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:14,956
Henry! Ohh!

1373
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:16,291
Oh, Nancy!

1374
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:18,524
Over here!
Swing to me, honey!

1375
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,861
I would love to!

1376
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:22,232
Ok. Henry,
give me your foot!

1377
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:23,235
I'm trying!

1378
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:26,904
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1379
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:29,136
<i>Friday night</i>

1380
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:31,575
<i>- And the strip is hot
- Hot</i>

1381
00:52:32,913 --> 00:52:33,971
Ooh! Give me
your coat!

1382
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:35,515
- I'm trying!
- Aah!

1383
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,312
Give me your coat!
I got it!

1384
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:38,817
Henry, come on!

1385
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:40,148
Ohh!

1386
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,915
Oh!

1387
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:43,547
Come on, Henry!

1388
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:45,922
Ow! Ohh!
Aah! Aah!

1389
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:47,017
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1390
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:52,498
Oh, now what the...

1391
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:55,558
bloody hell
is going on here?

1392
00:52:57,438 --> 00:53:00,896
- Man: Where's the manager?!
- Henry.

1393
00:53:00,975 --> 00:53:02,340
Can't I have
a moment's...

1394
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,843
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1395
00:53:04,912 --> 00:53:05,844
Shut up!

1396
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:08,848
Ohh! All right,
all right.

1397
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:11,578
Don't get your knickers
in a twist.

1398
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,210
Look.

1399
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:15,050
Can't a girl
have some fun?

1400
00:53:25,532 --> 00:53:28,092
I could've danced
all night.

1401
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,103
Let's go.

1402
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:33,765
Come on,
let's go.

1403
00:53:35,876 --> 00:53:38,970
Hey! Hey, you're
the manager, right?

1404
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:40,638
Hello! You
checked me in!

1405
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:42,477
Let me tell you
something.

1406
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:44,483
Norman Bates could
do a better job

1407
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:46,815
of running this hotel
than you could.

1408
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:49,822
You've got scam artists
waltzing into people's rooms,

1409
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,323
morons delivering
room service,

1410
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:52,984
and on top of that,

1411
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,994
you can't even keep
the lights on!

1412
00:53:55,062 --> 00:53:57,997
Huh? Well, I am
an unsatisfied customer!

1413
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:00,829
So you better
deal with me!

1414
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:02,368
Shut up!

1415
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:05,704
Silly bitch!

1416
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:08,037
Greg: Ohh!

1417
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:10,542
Henry, walk normally.

1418
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:11,543
Walk normally.
Don't run.

1419
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:13,045
Don't run, honey.

1420
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:14,546
Taxi! Taxi!

1421
00:54:14,615 --> 00:54:15,877
Are you crazy?

1422
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,382
We don't have
any money for a cab.

1423
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:19,316
Yes, we do. I took $20
from the Wellstones' room.

1424
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,581
Who are you?

1425
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:23,122
There's a taxi.

1426
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,283
- Hey! Hey!
- Taxi!

1427
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,849
Tax... Wait, honey.
Honey, wait.

1428
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:28,189
Come on, come on!

1429
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:31,730
Oh, my God, honey!

1430
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:34,290
Here! Now! Now! Now!

1431
00:54:34,368 --> 00:54:35,596
- Oh, my God!
- We got it!

1432
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:36,795
Whew!

1433
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,303
Oh! Oh, my God.

1434
00:54:38,372 --> 00:54:40,636
Are we lucky
we found you.

1435
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,335
Second Avenue and
St. Mark's Place, please.

1436
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:43,569
That's Susan's apartment.

1437
00:54:43,644 --> 00:54:45,202
Oh, Henry, please, let's
not argue about this.

1438
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:46,439
Get out.

1439
00:54:46,513 --> 00:54:48,105
- What?
- Excuse me?

1440
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:49,444
Get out of the cab now.

1441
00:54:49,516 --> 00:54:51,575
I think we better
get out, Henry.

1442
00:54:51,652 --> 00:54:52,983
Hey, we're not
getting out.

1443
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:54,315
He said to get out, Henry.
I think we should...

1444
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:55,412
Listen, I know
what the rules are.

1445
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:56,581
He has to take us

1446
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:57,851
anywhere in the 5 boroughs
we want to go.

1447
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,756
We're also entitled
to an incense-free ride.

1448
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:00,987
I'm telling you
one last time...

1449
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:01,993
Get out!

1450
00:55:02,062 --> 00:55:03,495
You might think we're

1451
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:04,895
insignificant
out-of-towners from Ohio,

1452
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:07,024
but I happen to know
what our rights are.

1453
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:08,193
In fact, I think I'm
just gonna write down

1454
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:09,735
your name
and license number.

1455
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,430
"Hortense...
Wilson. "

1456
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:13,097
- "Hortense"?
- "Hortense"?

1457
00:55:15,743 --> 00:55:16,675
What's that?

1458
00:55:16,744 --> 00:55:18,143
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1459
00:55:18,212 --> 00:55:19,873
I... I think... Aah!

1460
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:26,015
- What the hell is this?
- They wouldn't get out.

1461
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:27,053
Oh, no. Guess what.

1462
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:28,213
Guess what.
We changed our mind.

1463
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:29,516
W- We'd like to get out
over there on the corner.

1464
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,955
If you could just pull over,
it would be...

1465
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:32,286
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

1466
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:39,154
If you let us off
at the next corner,

1467
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:40,723
my wife and I
give you our oath

1468
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:41,825
we will not
bear witness.

1469
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:43,392
Nancy, tell them we will
not bear witness.

1470
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,562
No, we will not
bear witness.

1471
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:45,798
We don't know how
to bear witness.

1472
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:47,033
We've never...
We've never...

1473
00:55:47,107 --> 00:55:48,039
Shut up!

1474
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:51,210
Hey! I got it!
I got it!

1475
00:55:51,278 --> 00:55:52,210
They got the gun!

1476
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:54,914
Out, Nancy! Out!

1477
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,817
Look out!
Jump! Jump! Jump!

1478
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,678
Oh!

1479
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:02,688
Oh! Ow! Jeez!

1480
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:03,745
Are you ok?

1481
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:04,756
Are you ok, baby?

1482
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:05,757
Let me catch
my breath.

1483
00:56:05,826 --> 00:56:06,758
Are you ok?

1484
00:56:06,827 --> 00:56:07,759
Oh, Henry.

1485
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:08,692
Oh, my God.

1486
00:56:08,762 --> 00:56:09,694
I'm shaking.

1487
00:56:09,763 --> 00:56:11,025
Do you believe
what just happened?

1488
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:12,190
I know, honey.

1489
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:13,934
Oh, my God.
You're so brave.

1490
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:14,863
Nah, not really.

1491
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:15,867
Oh, you are, honey.

1492
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,166
You're a hero.
You saved our lives.

1493
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:19,262
Well, maybe just
a little bit.

1494
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:20,931
Come on. Are you ok?
Now come on. Huh?

1495
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:23,475
Henry, I saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.

1496
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:25,340
All I could
think of was,

1497
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:27,277
I'll never see
my children again.

1498
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:30,974
Did you think
about me at all?

1499
00:56:31,051 --> 00:56:34,145
Oh, there was...
so little time.

1500
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,551
You had time for
your whole life

1501
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:37,112
to pass in front
of your eyes,

1502
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,350
and I wasn't in it?

1503
00:56:38,425 --> 00:56:40,655
Oh, Henry, please.
Don't be so sensitive.

1504
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,251
Of course I'm gonna think
about the children

1505
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:43,694
at a time like this.

1506
00:56:43,763 --> 00:56:45,287
They're my kids.
They need me.

1507
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:46,696
I'm all they've got.

1508
00:56:46,766 --> 00:56:47,733
And who am I,

1509
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:49,063
the anonymous
sperm donor?

1510
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:51,660
Well, you might
as well be.

1511
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:53,672
You asked for that one.

1512
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,708
What do you mean
by that?

1513
00:56:55,775 --> 00:56:57,800
Well, the way you're treating
Susan, for one, Henry.

1514
00:56:59,813 --> 00:57:01,075
Let me...

1515
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:03,581
Let me just say...
You know,

1516
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,208
we have to learn to think
about each other more,

1517
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:06,309
because the kids are gone,

1518
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:08,149
and we're all we have.

1519
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:10,348
Well, you make that
sound appealing.

1520
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:11,355
Because unless we
find some way

1521
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:12,448
of relating
to each other

1522
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:13,514
and find some
common ground...

1523
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:15,026
- We what?
- You know, we...

1524
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:16,528
we are gonna...

1525
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:18,257
What? What, Henry?
We're gonna get a divorce?

1526
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:19,798
Is that what you're
trying to say?

1527
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:21,060
What I'm saying

1528
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:23,295
is that you have
to learn to let go,

1529
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,361
and you have to get
over this fear

1530
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:27,497
of not being able
to play Mommy anymore.

1531
00:57:28,842 --> 00:57:30,969
I want a divorce.

1532
00:57:32,278 --> 00:57:34,212
Nancy,
that's ridiculous.

1533
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,542
That's right.

1534
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:36,877
I'm ridiculous,

1535
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,475
which is exactly what you
used to like about me.

1536
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:42,350
But you have become
incredibly stubborn

1537
00:57:42,422 --> 00:57:44,253
and insensitive
and set in your ways.

1538
00:57:44,324 --> 00:57:47,521
And after 27 years,
I've had enough!

1539
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:56,561
Well, you have really
been mistreated.

1540
00:57:56,636 --> 00:58:00,094
While other husbands
are out getting drunk

1541
00:58:00,173 --> 00:58:02,937
and having sex
with 18-year-olds,

1542
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,840
what does
your husband do?

1543
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:06,640
He's a little boring.

1544
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:08,681
He's a little
insensitive.

1545
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:11,012
Big deal.

1546
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:12,915
I don't know how
you put up with it,

1547
00:58:12,986 --> 00:58:14,351
Madame Bovary!

1548
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:17,950
Oh!

1549
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:23,521
Oh!

1550
00:58:34,941 --> 00:58:36,374
There you are.

1551
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:37,967
Oh!

1552
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:41,104
Oh... Henry.

1553
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:42,443
Oh.

1554
00:58:44,684 --> 00:58:46,584
I'm sorry, honey.

1555
00:58:50,623 --> 00:58:53,888
Oh, how did
we get here?

1556
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,825
We just got older,
that's all.

1557
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,760
I don't mind
getting older, Henry.

1558
00:58:57,831 --> 00:59:00,322
Neither do I.
I don't.

1559
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,527
I don't even
want to be 17 again.

1560
00:59:02,602 --> 00:59:04,035
Neither do I.

1561
00:59:04,104 --> 00:59:07,699
That notion that
when you're younger,

1562
00:59:07,774 --> 00:59:09,173
everything
is perfect.

1563
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:15,104
I wouldn't mind feeling
like I'm 17 sometimes.

1564
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:16,512
I wouldn't, either.

1565
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:19,910
How do we do that?

1566
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:34,189
Oh, Henry. When
we were younger,

1567
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:36,235
this would've been
one big adventure.

1568
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:37,735
Yeah, I know.

1569
00:59:37,804 --> 00:59:39,237
Well, I don't know.

1570
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:41,034
We used to have fun.

1571
00:59:41,107 --> 00:59:42,165
Yeah.

1572
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:44,733
Remember your
grandfather's house?

1573
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,870
We were in that
little stupid motel,

1574
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:47,935
and then we made
love all night

1575
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:49,276
'cause we were
so scared.

1576
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:50,714
That's where you
killed my grandfather.

1577
00:59:50,783 --> 00:59:52,045
Oh, I did not.

1578
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:53,210
Yes, you did.

1579
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:54,378
Henry.

1580
00:59:54,454 --> 00:59:55,546
You can't
wear that outfit

1581
00:59:55,622 --> 00:59:56,919
around a man without
a single open artery.

1582
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:57,922
What outfit?

1583
00:59:57,991 --> 01:00:00,892
The one with the black
tight pants

1584
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,393
with that daffodil patch.

1585
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:03,895
You remember that?

1586
01:00:03,963 --> 01:00:04,895
Yeah.

1587
01:00:04,964 --> 01:00:06,056
What else?
What else?

1588
01:00:06,132 --> 01:00:07,759
I remember you had that
heart-shaped blouse

1589
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,199
with that big
heart thing.

1590
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:11,260
You looked like a person
who worked in a hospital.

1591
01:00:11,337 --> 01:00:12,998
Oh, that's sexy.

1592
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:18,768
<i>That old black magic
has me</i>

1593
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:21,370
<i>In its spell</i>

1594
01:00:21,447 --> 01:00:22,379
<i>That old...</i>

1595
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:26,746
Where are we?

1596
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:29,086
Yeah.

1597
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:31,089
There's nobody here.

1598
01:00:31,157 --> 01:00:32,089
Hmm.

1599
01:00:32,158 --> 01:00:33,455
Well.

1600
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:36,120
You look so sexy
right now.

1601
01:00:36,196 --> 01:00:37,288
Thank you.

1602
01:00:37,363 --> 01:00:38,955
I guess it's that
rolling-out-of-a-cab look

1603
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:40,465
you like, huh?

1604
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,501
You smell sexy.

1605
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:44,503
Oh, Henry.

1606
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:56,106
Henry.

1607
01:00:56,182 --> 01:00:57,615
I hear music.

1608
01:00:57,684 --> 01:00:59,618
A kiss will do that.

1609
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:01,244
Mmm.

1610
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:02,754
Thank you very much.

1611
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:04,312
And now, ladies
and gentlemen,

1612
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,550
the Mayor of New York...

1613
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,093
the Honorable
Rudy Giuliani.

1614
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:10,095
- Yes.
- Hear! Hear!

1615
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:16,867
Thank you very much.

1616
01:01:16,936 --> 01:01:18,198
This evening
would not be possible

1617
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:19,898
without the generosity
and perseverance

1618
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:22,032
of Mrs. Florence Needleman,

1619
01:01:22,108 --> 01:01:24,235
who, as part of our
"Light Up the City" campaign,

1620
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:26,710
is dedicating
a part of the park

1621
01:01:26,779 --> 01:01:28,440
in loving memory
of her husband Manny.

1622
01:01:28,514 --> 01:01:30,106
Mrs. Needleman.

1623
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:41,754
Manny and I shared some
of our loveliest memories

1624
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:43,455
here in Central Park,

1625
01:01:43,529 --> 01:01:45,997
and my Manny would be
so happy to know

1626
01:01:46,065 --> 01:01:48,056
that we have
returned the park

1627
01:01:48,134 --> 01:01:51,626
to the good, law-abiding
citizens of New York.

1628
01:01:51,704 --> 01:01:53,797
Honey!
Oh, honey!

1629
01:01:53,873 --> 01:01:55,932
And he'd
be especially pleased

1630
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:58,534
with the new monument
that has been erected.

1631
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:00,476
Ahh! Oh, Henry!

1632
01:02:00,546 --> 01:02:02,537
So, without further ado,

1633
01:02:02,615 --> 01:02:04,583
let's get to it.

1634
01:02:04,651 --> 01:02:07,552
Ahh! Ahh!
Oh, Henry!

1635
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,882
Oh.

1636
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:15,756
- Come on, baby!
- Oh, Henry!

1637
01:02:15,828 --> 01:02:17,420
We gotta go, baby.
Come on.

1638
01:02:17,497 --> 01:02:18,486
This is
so embarrassing.

1639
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:19,496
Put your pants on.

1640
01:02:19,565 --> 01:02:20,725
This way! This way!

1641
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,098
Nancy:
They're chasing us.

1642
01:02:23,169 --> 01:02:25,296
"Public fornication" won't
look good on my résumé.

1643
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:27,737
Oh, Henry,
I got grass...

1644
01:02:27,807 --> 01:02:30,503
grass...
grass in my ass.

1645
01:02:30,576 --> 01:02:31,804
Halt!

1646
01:02:36,683 --> 01:02:38,548
Henry, run faster!
Faster!

1647
01:02:38,618 --> 01:02:40,108
Looking
for 2 suspects on foot.

1648
01:02:40,186 --> 01:02:42,848
A white male and female,
partially disrobed.

1649
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:47,550
Come on.

1650
01:02:54,734 --> 01:02:56,292
I think we lost
them, honey.

1651
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:57,301
Over here.

1652
01:02:58,371 --> 01:02:59,804
Were we nuts?

1653
01:02:59,872 --> 01:03:02,636
Well, we just got lost
in our essence.

1654
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:04,142
There's cops
everywhere.

1655
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,541
We're gonna have to
lay low for a while.

1656
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:06,805
There's something
I never thought

1657
01:03:06,879 --> 01:03:08,107
I'd hear myself say.

1658
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:09,978
Yeah. Get down,
sweetie.

1659
01:03:10,049 --> 01:03:11,676
Yeah, yeah.
Excuse me.

1660
01:03:11,751 --> 01:03:13,514
Let's just stay here
for a few minutes.

1661
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:15,053
All right.
Just for a second.

1662
01:03:16,556 --> 01:03:17,989
Ok. Want a mint?

1663
01:03:18,057 --> 01:03:19,490
Where'd you
get this?

1664
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:21,993
I stole that, too.

1665
01:03:22,061 --> 01:03:23,494
From the Wellstones.

1666
01:03:23,563 --> 01:03:24,996
Yeah. From their pillows.

1667
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:27,259
You should've stole
their pillows, too.

1668
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,493
I know.

1669
01:03:28,568 --> 01:03:31,401
Oh, sweetie.

1670
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:32,995
Well, I'm glad
we finally

1671
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:35,199
got more time
for ourselves.

1672
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:36,502
Yeah.

1673
01:03:36,576 --> 01:03:39,101
What time's
your interview tomorrow?

1674
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:41,839
10:00.

1675
01:03:41,914 --> 01:03:43,176
Mmm.

1676
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,682
Ahh.

1677
01:04:21,854 --> 01:04:22,786
Hold it.

1678
01:04:22,855 --> 01:04:23,753
Oh, sorry.

1679
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:24,790
Ok, mister.

1680
01:04:24,857 --> 01:04:26,051
Oh, no. This is not
what it looks like.

1681
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,592
Public exposure is what
it looks like. Come on.

1682
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:31,653
Nancy?

1683
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:32,663
Nancy.

1684
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:34,131
I don't care
what you call it.

1685
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,758
Just keep it zipped up.
Let's go.

1686
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:36,859
Nancy!

1687
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:39,867
Nancy!

1688
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:40,871
Henry?

1689
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,033
Nancy!

1690
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:44,371
Henry.

1691
01:04:44,443 --> 01:04:45,876
This is a mistake.

1692
01:04:45,945 --> 01:04:48,072
If you call Dun & Bradley
Advertising,

1693
01:04:48,147 --> 01:04:49,580
they'll tell you

1694
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:51,082
I have an interview there
this morning.

1695
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,618
I'm not a criminal,
I'm not a degenerate,

1696
01:04:53,686 --> 01:04:56,678
and I don't deserve
to be locked up with...

1697
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:59,657
...out proper
medical attention.

1698
01:04:59,725 --> 01:05:00,851
I have a severely
sprained neck.

1699
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:02,917
We'll straighten
that out for you.

1700
01:05:05,998 --> 01:05:09,900
This is Sergeant Jordan
at the desk at the 1-5.

1701
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:11,630
When's your commanding
officer gonna be back?

1702
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:15,765
He's on lunch break.
Oh, great.

1703
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:17,934
You got some racket there.
It's a long lunch break.

1704
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,535
Great. All right.
Let me give you

1705
01:05:20,613 --> 01:05:21,978
the information on this,
all right?

1706
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:23,709
The woman's name
is Florence Klein,

1707
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:26,047
and she's at 585
Beck Avenue. Right.

1708
01:05:26,118 --> 01:05:27,244
Hello.

1709
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:29,253
Correct. Lady,
I'm busy. Not now.

1710
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:30,379
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, ok.

1711
01:05:30,456 --> 01:05:32,151
I have a little bit
of a problem.

1712
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:33,782
My husband has a job
interview in 2 hours,

1713
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:35,554
and I need
to use the phone

1714
01:05:35,628 --> 01:05:37,357
because I have
to arrange for bail.

1715
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,330
Public phones are right
down the hallway there.

1716
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:41,559
I know, but that'll take
at least an hour,

1717
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:43,329
and I don't have
that kind of time.

1718
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:45,131
And if I could just
use your phone,

1719
01:05:45,204 --> 01:05:46,671
I promise I'll call
collect and I...

1720
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:49,139
Lady. Give me
a break, ok?

1721
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:52,473
Give you a break?

1722
01:05:53,746 --> 01:05:56,306
Give you a break?

1723
01:05:56,382 --> 01:05:57,747
Hey!

1724
01:05:57,817 --> 01:05:59,785
Let me share
something with you.

1725
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,786
In the last 24 hours,

1726
01:06:01,854 --> 01:06:05,415
I have been rerouted,
mugged, evicted,

1727
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:07,516
chased by a dog,
kidnapped,

1728
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:08,958
chased by a horse,

1729
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:10,962
and seen in a compromising
position by the mayor.

1730
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,395
I just found out
that my daughter

1731
01:06:12,465 --> 01:06:13,830
is spending us
into the poorhouse

1732
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:15,594
and that my husband
has no job.

1733
01:06:15,668 --> 01:06:19,035
I'm angry, I'm tired,
and I'm hungry,

1734
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:20,732
and I'm running
with the wolves!

1735
01:06:20,806 --> 01:06:23,604
And right now, I am one
crazy bitch from Ohio!

1736
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:25,610
So why don't you
give me a break!

1737
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:34,550
Do I dial 9 to get out?

1738
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,212
Officer, I got

1739
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,448
the most important meeting
of my life in 2 hours.

1740
01:06:37,523 --> 01:06:38,455
Can't you just call
somebody or spea...

1741
01:06:38,524 --> 01:06:40,116
What you makin'
all that noise for?

1742
01:06:40,192 --> 01:06:43,559
Forget it. You can scream
in here till you croak.

1743
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:45,563
The whole damn thing
gives me a headache.

1744
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,064
I got one.

1745
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:49,294
Well, take an aspirin.

1746
01:06:49,368 --> 01:06:52,929
Anything to shut
your mouth up.

1747
01:06:53,005 --> 01:06:53,937
Thank you.

1748
01:06:55,441 --> 01:06:56,874
Nobody home?

1749
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:59,206
No. My daughter's
not there.

1750
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:00,540
My son's somewhere
in London.

1751
01:07:00,613 --> 01:07:02,513
I don't know anybody
else in New York.

1752
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:03,843
Well, where
are you staying?

1753
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,349
Can't your hotel
give you a loan?

1754
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:06,850
Oh, my God.

1755
01:07:06,919 --> 01:07:08,511
The manager threw us
out of the hotel.

1756
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:09,679
He hates us.

1757
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:10,847
He wouldn't eve...

1758
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,749
<i>Toot toot</i>

1759
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:16,795
<i>Hey</i>

1760
01:07:16,862 --> 01:07:18,056
<i>Beep beep</i>

1761
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:21,156
So you saw the "do not
disturb" sign on the door...

1762
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:22,165
Yes.

1763
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:23,667
And then you knocked

1764
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:25,067
to see if it was
supposed to be out there.

1765
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:26,399
Sir. I have
a call for you.

1766
01:07:26,472 --> 01:07:27,530
Excuse me, Howard.

1767
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:29,164
I'll explain the rest
of your life to you

1768
01:07:29,241 --> 01:07:30,708
in a moment.

1769
01:07:30,776 --> 01:07:31,936
Thank you so much,
Michelle.

1770
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:33,444
Good morning.
Mersault speaking.

1771
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,036
Nancy: Mr. Mersault?

1772
01:07:35,114 --> 01:07:37,810
Hi. This is Nancy Clark
from Ohio.

1773
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:39,976
You threw us out of
your hotel last night.

1774
01:07:40,052 --> 01:07:41,485
How are you?

1775
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:43,044
Oh, I'm very well,
thank you.

1776
01:07:43,122 --> 01:07:44,555
How nice of you
to stay in touch.

1777
01:07:44,623 --> 01:07:46,113
I wish all our freeloaders
were as conscientious.

1778
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:48,092
Well, as much as I would
like to chew the fat,

1779
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,627
this really isn't
a courtesy call.

1780
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,128
I need you
to do me a favor.

1781
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:52,721
Mrs. Clark,
let me explain.

1782
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:55,562
If you are a paying
guest at this hotel,

1783
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:57,067
I fawn, I grovel.

1784
01:07:57,136 --> 01:07:59,195
I am, in fact,
your very plaything.

1785
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:00,568
But if you're not a guest,
you do not exist.

1786
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,504
So there is no need
for me to talk to you.

1787
01:08:02,575 --> 01:08:04,406
Oh, I think you're
definitely

1788
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:06,341
gonna want to speak
to me, Mr. Mersault.

1789
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:08,004
Why on Earth
would that be?

1790
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,069
Because last night
at the hotel,

1791
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:11,981
you looked so fabulous

1792
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:14,315
in that wonderful
full-length sable coat.

1793
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:17,947
And those stiletto heels
were absolutely...

1794
01:08:18,023 --> 01:08:19,115
Go away.

1795
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:21,785
Yes?

1796
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:23,795
And I must tell you

1797
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:26,354
that I have never seen
a man kick so high.

1798
01:08:26,432 --> 01:08:28,127
And after they
send you to jail,

1799
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,360
you can do
your little act

1800
01:08:29,435 --> 01:08:30,766
for all the prisoners.

1801
01:08:30,836 --> 01:08:32,030
They'll love it.

1802
01:08:32,104 --> 01:08:33,537
Congratulations,
Mrs. Clark.

1803
01:08:33,606 --> 01:08:35,335
I had an intuition
you'd be good at blackmail.

1804
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:38,205
So, uh, how may I be
of service to you?

1805
01:08:38,277 --> 01:08:40,040
I need bail money
at the 15th Precinct,

1806
01:08:40,112 --> 01:08:41,636
and I need it here
right now.

1807
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:43,341
And bring some muffins.

1808
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:45,280
But, of course.

1809
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:46,750
Muffins.

1810
01:08:48,821 --> 01:08:50,652
The presidential suite

1811
01:08:50,723 --> 01:08:52,156
comes with the compliments
of the hotel,

1812
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:53,191
as, of course,
does the limo.

1813
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:54,749
Or should I say
getaway car?

1814
01:08:54,827 --> 01:08:56,021
Now before we get
to the hotel,

1815
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:58,563
I'd just like you to sign
this document, if you would,

1816
01:08:58,631 --> 01:09:01,099
agreeing never to discuss,
disclose, or reveal

1817
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:03,464
the incident at the hotel
when I was, in fact,

1818
01:09:03,535 --> 01:09:05,560
rehearsing for the hotel
employees' follies.

1819
01:09:05,638 --> 01:09:06,696
Thank you so much.

1820
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:08,501
Very good.

1821
01:09:08,574 --> 01:09:10,405
You look great.

1822
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:11,408
Thanks, sweetie.

1823
01:09:11,477 --> 01:09:13,502
You look really great.

1824
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:14,511
Thanks.

1825
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,547
Doesn't she look great?

1826
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:17,377
Well, I wouldn't
mind the blouse.

1827
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:18,575
No, not the blouse.

1828
01:09:18,651 --> 01:09:20,141
I mean, she just
looks great.

1829
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:23,086
She's got
a great ass.

1830
01:09:23,155 --> 01:09:24,645
Henry?

1831
01:09:24,723 --> 01:09:26,554
Well, it is. It's just
always there for me.

1832
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,557
Oh.

1833
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:29,457
It's been a wellspring
of joy, really.

1834
01:09:29,528 --> 01:09:30,620
A what?

1835
01:09:30,696 --> 01:09:32,027
What do you think?

1836
01:09:32,097 --> 01:09:33,257
Well, I think
it's a private, uh...

1837
01:09:33,332 --> 01:09:34,526
Well, come on. I mean,
everybody knows.

1838
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,965
It's the elephant
in the room,

1839
01:09:36,035 --> 01:09:37,024
and now we're finally
talking about it.

1840
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:38,535
Henry, what is
wrong with you?

1841
01:09:38,604 --> 01:09:40,071
Nothing.

1842
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:41,071
Uh?

1843
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,200
I just feel frisky,
that's all.

1844
01:09:44,276 --> 01:09:46,210
You feel frisky?

1845
01:09:46,278 --> 01:09:48,405
Frisky. Frisky.

1846
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,845
Say the word "frisky. "

1847
01:09:49,915 --> 01:09:50,847
Frisky.

1848
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,042
- Frisky.
- Yeah.

1849
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:53,049
Say "frisky" again.

1850
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:54,050
Frisky, Henry.

1851
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:55,177
Frisky. Say "frisky. "

1852
01:09:55,254 --> 01:09:56,619
Say the word
"frisky. "

1853
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,179
Frisky.

1854
01:09:58,257 --> 01:10:00,020
Frisky. Say "frisky. "

1855
01:10:00,092 --> 01:10:01,889
Frisky.

1856
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:02,928
Frisky. Say the word
"frisky. " It's fun.

1857
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:05,429
Frisky. Yes, yes.
It is rather fun.

1858
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:08,762
Ha ha ha ha!

1859
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,597
Say, is there a playground
or something nearby,

1860
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:13,194
say, maybe with swings
or monkey bars?

1861
01:10:13,272 --> 01:10:15,001
There's a very well-equipped
health club at the hotel

1862
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:16,632
which you're welcome to use
once you've signed...

1863
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:17,641
Yecch!

1864
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,974
Yecch. Health club.
Eggh!

1865
01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:21,512
Oh, my God. Henry.

1866
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,013
Henry, look at me.

1867
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:24,208
Your eyes look
really funny.

1868
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:25,614
Did you eat or drink
anything in jail?

1869
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:26,616
No.

1870
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:27,709
Mmm, you didn't?

1871
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:28,718
No. I just...
I had an aspirin.

1872
01:10:28,787 --> 01:10:29,913
Are you sure
it was an aspirin?

1873
01:10:29,989 --> 01:10:32,389
A prisoner
gave it to me.

1874
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:34,858
Oh, well, if a prisoner
gave it to him.

1875
01:10:34,927 --> 01:10:35,894
Oh!

1876
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:37,394
Can you pull over?
Would you pull over?

1877
01:10:37,463 --> 01:10:38,828
No. Don't pull over.

1878
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:40,023
Don't pull over.

1879
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:41,066
Pullover.

1880
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:42,259
Pullover.
Like a sweater.

1881
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:43,767
A pullover sweater.

1882
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:45,701
And it's the same
as "pull over. "

1883
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:48,501
To pull over,
and yet,

1884
01:10:48,574 --> 01:10:49,802
it's a sweater.

1885
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,275
<i>When the moon
is in the seventh house...</i>

1886
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:53,276
So could you pull over?

1887
01:10:53,345 --> 01:10:55,677
I mean, like...
like right now.

1888
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:59,707
<i>And Jupiter aligns
with Mars...</i>

1889
01:10:59,785 --> 01:11:02,348
Too confining.
Too confining.

1890
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:04,150
Henry! Henry!

1891
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:05,986
Henry!

1892
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:09,323
<i>And love
will steer the stars</i>

1893
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:14,264
<i>This is the dawning
of the Age of Aquarius</i>

1894
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:19,635
<i>The Age of Aquarius</i>

1895
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:29,405
<i>Aquarius</i>

1896
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:32,080
<i>Harmony and
understanding</i>

1897
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:33,175
Uh!

1898
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:35,550
<i>Sympathy and trust
abounding</i>

1899
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:36,747
Uh!

1900
01:11:36,822 --> 01:11:37,754
<i>No more falsehoods
or derisions...</i>

1901
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:39,154
Oh. Oh, honey.

1902
01:11:39,224 --> 01:11:42,682
Oh, look at the beautiful
oneness of this tree.

1903
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:44,194
What it is for us.
It becomes us.

1904
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:46,697
Do you feel
its ontological being?

1905
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:47,789
Do you feel it?

1906
01:11:47,866 --> 01:11:48,833
What?

1907
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:49,959
Nancy.

1908
01:11:50,035 --> 01:11:51,434
Guess whose voice
I'm hearing

1909
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:52,492
from inside the tree?

1910
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:54,732
The Earth's?

1911
01:11:54,807 --> 01:11:56,570
I'm hearing the voice
of Baba Ram Dass.

1912
01:11:56,642 --> 01:11:58,075
Remember Baba Ram Dass

1913
01:11:58,143 --> 01:12:00,373
and his inspirational tape
that we never listened to

1914
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:01,970
because it melted
in the car?

1915
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,173
Remember how sad we were?

1916
01:12:03,248 --> 01:12:04,681
I know, honey.

1917
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,116
We got all our priorities
all screwed up.

1918
01:12:07,186 --> 01:12:09,177
We do. We have our
priorities so screwed up.

1919
01:12:09,254 --> 01:12:10,983
We have to love more,
Nancy, don't we?

1920
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:12,216
Don't we have
to love more?

1921
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,986
We have to give it
to other people.

1922
01:12:14,059 --> 01:12:15,026
We have to... grr!

1923
01:12:15,094 --> 01:12:16,026
Henry!

1924
01:12:16,095 --> 01:12:17,027
Henry, no!

1925
01:12:17,096 --> 01:12:19,257
Come on, Nancy,
let's do her.

1926
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:21,993
<i>The Age of Aquarius</i>

1927
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:24,297
<i>The Age of Aquarius...</i>

1928
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:28,132
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack!

1929
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:29,936
Excuse us.

1930
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:33,101
Oh, my God.

1931
01:12:33,178 --> 01:12:34,543
Look at this.

1932
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:36,137
We have arrived.

1933
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:38,445
This is
the presidential suite.

1934
01:12:38,517 --> 01:12:39,677
Henry, no, no.
Honey. Honey.

1935
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:41,184
We've got 18 minutes

1936
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:42,220
to get you
to that interview, ok?

1937
01:12:42,287 --> 01:12:44,152
Who needs a job
if we have all this?

1938
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:45,884
Henry, we have nothing!

1939
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,016
Ok?

1940
01:12:47,092 --> 01:12:48,525
Now I'm gonna unpack,

1941
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:49,959
and I want you
to think advertising.

1942
01:12:50,028 --> 01:12:52,931
Think advertising.
All right.

1943
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:54,361
I'm going to focus
on advertising.

1944
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:55,364
Right.

1945
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:57,025
I am an advertising ma...

1946
01:12:57,101 --> 01:12:58,033
Henry?

1947
01:12:59,437 --> 01:13:00,529
Henry, no.

1948
01:13:00,605 --> 01:13:02,038
You have
to get dressed.

1949
01:13:02,106 --> 01:13:03,437
All right. All right.
I'm getting dressed.

1950
01:13:03,508 --> 01:13:05,373
Now... think.

1951
01:13:05,443 --> 01:13:07,035
I have an idea, baby.

1952
01:13:07,111 --> 01:13:08,976
What is the most unused
advertising space

1953
01:13:09,047 --> 01:13:10,139
in the world?

1954
01:13:10,214 --> 01:13:11,476
- What?
- The human tongue.

1955
01:13:11,549 --> 01:13:12,982
It's always
hanging out...

1956
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:14,484
People looking through
restaurant windows

1957
01:13:14,552 --> 01:13:15,576
and drooling

1958
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:17,245
and guys looking
at girls.

1959
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:18,482
That's
advertising space.

1960
01:13:18,556 --> 01:13:20,080
It'd be so easy
to write on there.

1961
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:21,284
You know, so-and-so's
breath mints.

1962
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:22,451
And... and dogs.

1963
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:23,892
You know, their tongues
are always hanging out.

1964
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:25,589
They wouldn't mind
a little tattoo

1965
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:27,096
that says "Alpo. "

1966
01:13:27,165 --> 01:13:28,496
Would you
write this down?

1967
01:13:28,566 --> 01:13:30,033
Don't worry. I never
forget a good idea.

1968
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:31,159
Well, say it
back to me.

1969
01:13:31,235 --> 01:13:32,327
Say it back.

1970
01:13:32,403 --> 01:13:33,495
Henry. Henry. It's time
to take a shower.

1971
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:34,503
Take a shower.
All right.

1972
01:13:34,572 --> 01:13:35,561
Yes. It's time
to take a shower.

1973
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,732
Ok, baby.

1974
01:13:36,808 --> 01:13:39,038
Your little genius
is gonna take a shower.

1975
01:13:42,914 --> 01:13:47,510
<i>Fly me to the moon</i>

1976
01:13:47,585 --> 01:13:53,080
<i>And let me swing
among the stars</i>

1977
01:13:53,157 --> 01:13:54,818
Hey, baby.

1978
01:13:54,892 --> 01:13:57,417
I think I found some more
unused advertising space.

1979
01:13:57,495 --> 01:14:02,956
<i>In other words</i>

1980
01:14:03,034 --> 01:14:07,528
<i>I love you</i>

1981
01:14:07,605 --> 01:14:09,232
Oh, my God.

1982
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,365
Ohh! Henry, no!

1983
01:14:11,442 --> 01:14:13,034
How nice to see you.

1984
01:14:13,111 --> 01:14:14,169
I'll have those pants
pressed for you

1985
01:14:14,245 --> 01:14:16,236
the moment that you
return, Mr. Clark.

1986
01:14:16,314 --> 01:14:17,338
Is there anything
that you need at all?

1987
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:18,382
A basket of fruit, perhaps?

1988
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:19,711
Have a nice day.

1989
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:21,012
Banana?

1990
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:22,017
Taxi.

1991
01:14:22,086 --> 01:14:23,849
Henry, put on
your pants,

1992
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:25,183
for God's sake!

1993
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:26,655
Oh!

1994
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:28,419
We'll get a cab up here.

1995
01:14:28,493 --> 01:14:30,017
Henry, get your pants on.

1996
01:14:30,094 --> 01:14:31,026
I'm getting them.

1997
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:32,027
Taxi!

1998
01:14:32,096 --> 01:14:33,063
Get your shoes on.

1999
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:34,120
I got it.

2000
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:35,222
We're gonna make it.

2001
01:14:35,299 --> 01:14:36,391
Gonna make it.

2002
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:38,662
Slow down, baby.
We got plenty of time.

2003
01:14:38,736 --> 01:14:39,896
Gonna make it.

2004
01:14:39,971 --> 01:14:41,336
Ok, we're almost here.

2005
01:14:41,406 --> 01:14:42,634
What time is it?

2006
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:45,335
We've got 2 minutes.
It's 2 minutes to 10:00.

2007
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,310
Go, go.
Here it is. 590.

2008
01:14:47,378 --> 01:14:48,310
Whoo!

2009
01:14:48,379 --> 01:14:49,311
Ok, go, go!

2010
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,110
Let's go, honey.

2011
01:14:53,718 --> 01:14:54,742
Come on, Henry.

2012
01:14:54,819 --> 01:14:57,818
Henry!

2013
01:14:57,889 --> 01:14:59,652
Henry, this way, honey.

2014
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:00,656
Come on!

2015
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:02,556
Sorry.

2016
01:15:02,627 --> 01:15:04,458
Ok, sweetie.
Come on.

2017
01:15:04,529 --> 01:15:05,962
Come on, you
look fabulous.

2018
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,657
Honey, I got
a good feeling.

2019
01:15:07,732 --> 01:15:08,756
I got a really
good feeling

2020
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:09,765
you're gonna
get the job.

2021
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,096
- Get the job?
- Yes, you are.

2022
01:15:11,169 --> 01:15:12,602
My coat, my coat.

2023
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:13,762
Ok.

2024
01:15:16,674 --> 01:15:18,141
You look good,
sweetheart.

2025
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:19,141
Ok.

2026
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,303
Button up your coat.

2027
01:15:33,991 --> 01:15:36,186
Ok, Henry.

2028
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,557
We're here.

2029
01:15:37,628 --> 01:15:39,493
Come on, sweetie.

2030
01:15:45,236 --> 01:15:46,726
Henry?

2031
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:48,169
This is not right.

2032
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,036
What? Yes, it is, Henry.
It is right.

2033
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:51,302
This is the floor, honey.

2034
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:52,967
Oh, I just can't
do this.

2035
01:15:53,044 --> 01:15:54,306
Henry! What?

2036
01:15:54,378 --> 01:15:56,243
No, Henry, you're
just stressed-out.

2037
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:57,872
I mean, everything
is fine.

2038
01:15:57,949 --> 01:15:59,746
Just don't mention
that tongue idea.

2039
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:01,250
Come on, honey.
Take my hand.

2040
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:02,251
Ok.

2041
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,787
- Come on.
- All rightie.

2042
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:05,413
Ok, Henry, now I
want you to visualize

2043
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:08,618
getting off the elevator.

2044
01:16:08,693 --> 01:16:09,625
I'm visualizing.

2045
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:10,626
- Ok.
- Coming off...

2046
01:16:10,695 --> 01:16:11,662
the elevator.
My hand's out.

2047
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:12,923
That feels good.

2048
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:13,929
It's a different
temperature, though.

2049
01:16:13,998 --> 01:16:15,124
Is it, honey?
Come on.

2050
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,325
You're gonna make it,
Henry.

2051
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,061
My hair is out.
My hair.

2052
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:19,228
Good.

2053
01:16:19,303 --> 01:16:20,292
Your foot's out.

2054
01:16:20,371 --> 01:16:21,770
Just put your foot out.

2055
01:16:21,839 --> 01:16:22,771
I just... I...

2056
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,330
Come on.
Come on, baby.

2057
01:16:24,408 --> 01:16:25,898
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

2058
01:16:25,977 --> 01:16:27,103
I'm just
burned out.

2059
01:16:27,178 --> 01:16:28,475
I'm just going
through the motions.

2060
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:30,411
I can't get out.
I know what he means.

2061
01:16:30,481 --> 01:16:31,413
What's your name?

2062
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:32,414
Paul.

2063
01:16:32,483 --> 01:16:33,415
We just can't
do this anymore.

2064
01:16:33,484 --> 01:16:35,645
Henry, Henry,
don't be irresponsible.

2065
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,019
I know that you took
a hallucinogenic in prison.

2066
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:42,457
But this does not mean
that you can't make an effort.

2067
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:44,085
- I can't.
- We can't!

2068
01:16:44,162 --> 01:16:45,754
You're not helping!

2069
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:47,889
Henry, who are you
gonna listen to,

2070
01:16:47,965 --> 01:16:50,525
your loving, trusting wife
of 27 years

2071
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:51,590
or this guy?

2072
01:16:51,669 --> 01:16:52,761
He understands me,

2073
01:16:52,837 --> 01:16:54,464
and you just can't
handle that, can you?

2074
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:56,530
We're one now.

2075
01:16:56,607 --> 01:16:57,699
Let's go, honey.

2076
01:16:57,775 --> 01:17:00,642
Yeah. Ok, good, Henry.

2077
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,740
Let's go.

2078
01:17:05,349 --> 01:17:07,476
So I go, no way.
And he goes, oh, so way.

2079
01:17:07,552 --> 01:17:08,780
Excuse me...

2080
01:17:08,853 --> 01:17:10,548
I go, you are
totally stupid.

2081
01:17:10,621 --> 01:17:11,553
Excuse me.

2082
01:17:11,622 --> 01:17:12,987
Hold on.
Can I help you?

2083
01:17:13,057 --> 01:17:14,649
I'm Henry Clark
to see Lisa Tobin.

2084
01:17:14,725 --> 01:17:15,657
Oh, you're Henry Clark.

2085
01:17:15,726 --> 01:17:18,320
I called your
house in Ohio,

2086
01:17:18,396 --> 01:17:19,920
and I tried leaving a message
at the hotel for you,

2087
01:17:19,997 --> 01:17:21,487
but they said you
hadn't checked in.

2088
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:22,828
The meeting was
moved to 9:00.

2089
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,733
Are you serious?

2090
01:17:25,803 --> 01:17:27,737
We didn't get
that message.

2091
01:17:27,805 --> 01:17:28,829
There's nothing
I can do.

2092
01:17:28,906 --> 01:17:30,669
I know, but, you know,
we had trouble

2093
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:31,708
getting into the hotel...

2094
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:32,936
We didn't get
our messages.

2095
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:35,171
The manager's
a transvestite.

2096
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:37,009
Ms. Tobin is preparing for
a meeting with some clients.

2097
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:38,639
Then she flies to London
for a week.

2098
01:17:38,716 --> 01:17:40,343
Sorry.

2099
01:17:40,418 --> 01:17:41,407
There must be
something you can do.

2100
01:17:41,485 --> 01:17:42,417
I mean...

2101
01:17:42,486 --> 01:17:44,010
See, this is a sign.

2102
01:17:44,088 --> 01:17:45,077
It's over.

2103
01:17:45,156 --> 01:17:46,646
Henry,
don't say that.

2104
01:17:46,724 --> 01:17:47,986
Nancy, look out there.

2105
01:17:48,059 --> 01:17:49,924
It's an entire city
saying "go home. "

2106
01:17:49,994 --> 01:17:51,859
You know what it says
on the Statue of Liberty?

2107
01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:53,658
"Give me your tired,
give me your poor.

2108
01:17:53,731 --> 01:17:55,528
Give me everybody
but Henry and Nancy Clark. "

2109
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,090
Henry, you're hungry.

2110
01:17:57,168 --> 01:17:58,396
If I just
get you a cracker,

2111
01:17:58,469 --> 01:17:59,800
you'll be filled
with hope again.

2112
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,497
No, I'll just be
filled with cracker.

2113
01:18:01,572 --> 01:18:02,504
It's over.

2114
01:18:02,573 --> 01:18:03,801
What about
marrow-sucking?

2115
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:05,637
What about
embracing life?

2116
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,371
Nancy, we're
too old for that.

2117
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:12,946
Ok.

2118
01:18:14,185 --> 01:18:15,846
All right, Henry.

2119
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,909
The plane leaves
at 2:30.

2120
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:19,684
I'm gonna be on it.

2121
01:18:19,757 --> 01:18:21,884
I'm gonna go back
to the hotel.

2122
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:23,927
I have just
enough energy to...

2123
01:18:23,995 --> 01:18:26,657
steal some towels from
the presidential suite.

2124
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:29,492
Well, Henry...

2125
01:18:30,735 --> 01:18:32,965
I guess New York won.

2126
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:43,043
New York won.

2127
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:47,675
New York won?

2128
01:18:51,656 --> 01:18:54,147
Uh-huh.
No, it's permanent.

2129
01:18:54,225 --> 01:18:55,590
You never have
to wax again.

2130
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,684
Excuse me.

2131
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:57,693
Of course it hurts.

2132
01:18:57,762 --> 01:18:59,024
Oh, it is so
totally worth it.

2133
01:18:59,096 --> 01:19:00,791
I mean, what,
with global warming,

2134
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:02,196
you're gonna be in a bathing
suit all year long.

2135
01:19:02,266 --> 01:19:03,733
I'm sorry. This is an emergency.
If I could just...

2136
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:05,928
Gimme a break, ok?

2137
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:07,197
Sorry. Go ahead.

2138
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:11,575
Give you a break?

2139
01:19:11,642 --> 01:19:14,634
Hey... listen.

2140
01:19:14,712 --> 01:19:17,306
In the past 24 hours,
I have destroyed a car,

2141
01:19:17,381 --> 01:19:18,678
been thrown out
of a hotel,

2142
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:20,410
forced to reveal my
most intimate secrets

2143
01:19:20,484 --> 01:19:22,679
to a group of nymphomaniacs
and masturbators,

2144
01:19:22,753 --> 01:19:24,687
watched my wife
seduce a man for dinner,

2145
01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:25,813
threatened with divorce,

2146
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,380
arrested for
public urination,

2147
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,359
and drugged by Jacko,
my new prison pal.

2148
01:19:30,428 --> 01:19:31,986
I have a house,
and a mortgage,

2149
01:19:32,063 --> 01:19:34,497
and a son in college,
and a daughter in the theater.

2150
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:37,033
And I'm one of those nice,
quiet Midwestern guys

2151
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,898
that no one expects to snap,

2152
01:19:38,969 --> 01:19:42,735
but when we do,
watch it, baby!

2153
01:19:42,807 --> 01:19:44,069
Come on in.
Meet the team.

2154
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:47,076
Bill, Rita, David, Michael,
this is Henry Clark,

2155
01:19:47,144 --> 01:19:49,738
formerly of Sellinski
Advertising in Ohio.

2156
01:19:49,814 --> 01:19:50,803
Hi. How are you?

2157
01:19:50,881 --> 01:19:52,473
He was scheduled
for 9:00.

2158
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:55,246
9:00, huh? Still on
Central Standard Time?

2159
01:19:55,319 --> 01:19:57,310
Well, actually, Ohio
is Eastern Standard Time.

2160
01:19:57,388 --> 01:19:59,083
A lot of people think
it's Central, but it's not.

2161
01:20:00,691 --> 01:20:01,783
Although Central
Standard Time

2162
01:20:01,859 --> 01:20:03,292
is a very, very
good time zone.

2163
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:06,353
It's just... It's not too early,
it's not too late.

2164
01:20:07,465 --> 01:20:11,231
It's... Its just central.

2165
01:20:11,302 --> 01:20:13,497
I don't get the joke.

2166
01:20:22,379 --> 01:20:24,847
Mr. Clark, your portfolio
is terrific.

2167
01:20:24,915 --> 01:20:27,110
But in an hour, we have
to pitch a follow-up

2168
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:28,173
to the "I Love
New York" campaign,

2169
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:29,981
and we're having
big problems.

2170
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:31,384
I wish our timing
had been better,

2171
01:20:31,455 --> 01:20:34,686
but thanks for coming up
and good luck.

2172
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,459
Oh.

2173
01:20:42,432 --> 01:20:43,797
Thank you.

2174
01:20:55,345 --> 01:20:58,473
I think we should start
with New York, New York,

2175
01:20:58,548 --> 01:21:00,948
and then pull back...

2176
01:21:01,018 --> 01:21:03,213
'cause that way,
it's definitely a start.

2177
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,346
It's big. It's bold.
I see that...

2178
01:21:05,422 --> 01:21:07,686
Do you know what
your problem is?

2179
01:21:09,026 --> 01:21:10,118
What did you say?

2180
01:21:10,193 --> 01:21:14,289
I said, "Do you know
what your problem is?"

2181
01:21:14,364 --> 01:21:16,628
No. What's my problem?

2182
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,497
You live here.

2183
01:21:18,568 --> 01:21:19,660
You're jaded.

2184
01:21:19,736 --> 01:21:22,102
What you need is
a fresh perspective

2185
01:21:22,172 --> 01:21:27,337
from an outsider
from, say, O... hio.

2186
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:28,673
Because you
have forgotten

2187
01:21:28,745 --> 01:21:30,975
just how amazing
this city is.

2188
01:21:31,048 --> 01:21:33,380
I have had more
experiences in this city

2189
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:34,849
than many people
who have lived here

2190
01:21:34,918 --> 01:21:35,885
their whole lives.

2191
01:21:35,952 --> 01:21:38,386
I mean, I met
colorful characters.

2192
01:21:38,455 --> 01:21:40,446
I've taken
a breathtaking cab ride

2193
01:21:40,524 --> 01:21:41,855
through Central Park.

2194
01:21:41,925 --> 01:21:45,190
I climbed to the top
of a luxury hotel.

2195
01:21:45,262 --> 01:21:46,786
Not in the elevator,

2196
01:21:46,863 --> 01:21:50,424
actually on the hotel.

2197
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,163
And then, I fell...

2198
01:21:54,237 --> 01:21:57,536
in love with my wife
all over again

2199
01:21:57,607 --> 01:21:59,165
at Tavern on the Green,

2200
01:21:59,242 --> 01:22:02,871
on the actual green
itself.

2201
01:22:02,946 --> 01:22:06,404
And... And then I had sex
in front of the mayor.

2202
01:22:06,483 --> 01:22:08,212
I mean, where else

2203
01:22:08,285 --> 01:22:10,515
can something
like this happen?

2204
01:22:10,587 --> 01:22:13,249
Only in New York!

2205
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:22,121
What did you just say?

2206
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:24,190
You mean the whole thing

2207
01:22:24,267 --> 01:22:25,564
or the tag line
for your new campaign...

2208
01:22:25,635 --> 01:22:26,567
"Only in New York"?

2209
01:22:26,636 --> 01:22:27,864
Which, incidentally,
I copyrighted

2210
01:22:27,938 --> 01:22:29,166
just before
I came up here,

2211
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:31,070
along with the visual
of the Statue of Liberty

2212
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:34,110
giving the high five
to a family of tourists.

2213
01:22:34,177 --> 01:22:36,771
Oh, this guy's very good.

2214
01:22:36,847 --> 01:22:38,508
Can I have a doughnut?

2215
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,982
Now, when
the princess arrives,

2216
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:43,451
try not to be alarmed
by her appearance,

2217
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,044
which is hideous.

2218
01:22:45,122 --> 01:22:47,090
Now do you have all
the Clarks' luggage?

2219
01:22:47,157 --> 01:22:48,590
I think there's also
a garment bag.

2220
01:22:48,658 --> 01:22:50,091
Well, if it's not
here in 60 seconds,

2221
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,627
I shall instruct
the hotel nurse

2222
01:22:51,695 --> 01:22:55,096
to give you
a lethal injection.

2223
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:57,258
Mrs. Clark,
good afternoon!

2224
01:22:57,334 --> 01:22:59,063
Your yellow chariot awaits,

2225
01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:00,899
and you have
a glorious day for flying.

2226
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:02,063
Up, up, and away.

2227
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:03,128
Oh, barf.

2228
01:23:03,206 --> 01:23:05,197
Ha ha ha.
My sentiments exactly.

2229
01:23:05,275 --> 01:23:07,140
If you see my husband,
would you do me a favor

2230
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,234
and give him
that ticket, please?

2231
01:23:08,311 --> 01:23:09,369
But, of course.
Such a good idea

2232
01:23:09,446 --> 01:23:10,777
to get a head start
to the airport.

2233
01:23:10,847 --> 01:23:11,871
Visit those fine shops.

2234
01:23:11,948 --> 01:23:13,040
Get to know
a Hare Krishna, perhaps.

2235
01:23:13,116 --> 01:23:14,640
Close the door,
please.

2236
01:23:14,718 --> 01:23:16,618
Hey! Hey, baby, hey.

2237
01:23:16,686 --> 01:23:18,313
Hold it. Hold it. Hey!

2238
01:23:18,388 --> 01:23:19,616
Hey, baby, baby,
don't go!

2239
01:23:19,689 --> 01:23:20,986
Go! Go! Go!

2240
01:23:21,057 --> 01:23:22,615
Don't go! Don't go!
Don't go! Don't go!

2241
01:23:22,692 --> 01:23:25,286
Don't go! Don't go!
Hey, hey!

2242
01:23:25,362 --> 01:23:26,488
Come here!
Come here!

2243
01:23:26,563 --> 01:23:27,495
Henry!

2244
01:23:27,564 --> 01:23:28,758
Come here! Come here!

2245
01:23:28,832 --> 01:23:30,026
What... What...
What is it?

2246
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,729
Ok. Now this is champagne,
and that is the limousine,

2247
01:23:33,804 --> 01:23:36,170
and this is what
we're celebrating.

2248
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,297
What?

2249
01:23:37,374 --> 01:23:39,308
It's the key to my new office.
I got the job.

2250
01:23:39,376 --> 01:23:40,343
Henry, you got the job!

2251
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:41,342
We're New Yorkers now.

2252
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:42,776
We're New Yorkers now!

2253
01:23:42,846 --> 01:23:43,778
We're never gonna leave!

2254
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:44,973
We're never
gonna leave!

2255
01:23:45,048 --> 01:23:46,481
Oh, no.
Please, God, no.

2256
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:49,018
And I got you
something, too.

2257
01:23:49,085 --> 01:23:50,814
Oh, honey...

2258
01:23:50,887 --> 01:23:51,979
you didn't have
to do this.

2259
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:52,987
I know, I know,
but I did.

2260
01:23:53,056 --> 01:23:54,023
Oh, my...

2261
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:57,457
Oh, you got me
a spare key.

2262
01:23:57,527 --> 01:23:59,051
It's the key
to your office.

2263
01:23:59,129 --> 01:24:01,825
Henry, are you
still high?

2264
01:24:01,898 --> 01:24:03,763
They want me to bring in
my own creative team.

2265
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:05,961
I can hire anyone I want,
and I want you.

2266
01:24:06,036 --> 01:24:08,197
I want my partner back.

2267
01:24:08,271 --> 01:24:09,203
Oh, Henry.

2268
01:24:09,272 --> 01:24:10,534
I mean, all the
best things in my life

2269
01:24:10,607 --> 01:24:11,631
have happened
because of you...

2270
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,938
the marriage
and the kids and work.

2271
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,409
And this is
how I'm happiest.

2272
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:17,310
This is crazy!

2273
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,211
No, no, no, no,
this makes sense.

2274
01:24:19,282 --> 01:24:20,874
You want to know what my
version of marrow-sucking is?

2275
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:21,975
What?

2276
01:24:22,052 --> 01:24:24,486
It's being with you.

2277
01:24:24,554 --> 01:24:26,044
That's how I suck.

2278
01:24:26,122 --> 01:24:27,680
Oh, Henry.

2279
01:24:34,431 --> 01:24:35,625
What's it pay?

2280
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:36,996
Excuse me...

2281
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:38,591
are you going to
the airport or not?

2282
01:24:38,668 --> 01:24:40,067
Why? We live here.

2283
01:24:40,136 --> 01:24:41,296
Oh!

2284
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,073
Only in New York.

2285
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:52,004
So, I take it you won't
be checking out today.

2286
01:24:52,082 --> 01:24:54,846
Or perhaps ever.

2287
01:24:54,918 --> 01:24:57,113
Barry, get the bags.

2288
01:24:57,187 --> 01:24:58,119
Bags!

2289
01:24:58,188 --> 01:24:59,120
What?

2290
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:00,121
- The bags!
- Where are they?

2291
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,122
They're in the cab!

2292
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:02,123
In the cab?!

2293
01:25:02,192 --> 01:25:04,422
My God...

2294
01:25:04,494 --> 01:25:06,894
I think I'm beginning
to like them.

2295
01:25:06,963 --> 01:25:08,260
Taxi!

2296
01:25:08,331 --> 01:25:11,767
Why do they paint
them all yellow?

2297
01:25:25,849 --> 01:25:26,816
Congratulations.

2298
01:25:26,883 --> 01:25:28,077
She's good,
isn't she?

2299
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:29,880
You should be proud.

2300
01:25:29,953 --> 01:25:31,784
Isn't the theater magical?

2301
01:25:31,855 --> 01:25:32,844
What?

2302
01:25:32,923 --> 01:25:34,720
Are those my earrings?

2303
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:37,885
Bravo! Bravo!

2304
01:26:55,405 --> 01:26:59,603
