1
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,420
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving
force behind Catholicism Wow!...

2
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,250
...Cardinal Glick.

3
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,340
Thank you, thank you.

4
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,300
Now, we all know
how the majority...

5
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,550
...and the media in this country...

6
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,850
...view the Catholic Church.

7
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,140
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

8
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,400
People find the Bible obtuse...

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,980
...even hokey.

10
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,150
Now, in an effort
to disprove all that...

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,900
...the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

12
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,030
...both of faith and of style.

13
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,080
For example, the crucifix.

14
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,870
While it has been a time-honored
symbol of our faith...

15
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,920
...Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,580
...this highly recognizable...

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,040
...yet wholly depressing image...

18
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,260
...of our Lord, crucified.

19
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,680
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

20
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,590
He came to help us out.

21
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,390
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

22
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,270
...that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring sigil.

23
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,270
So it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,940
...of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

25
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,530
...will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,820
..."The Buddy Christ."

27
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,460
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

28
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,040
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

29
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,590
But look at it.

30
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,550
Doesn't it pop?

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,260
Buddy Christ.

32
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,380
Well, there you have it.

33
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,270
Let me get this straight.

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,570
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?

35
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,070
No, Through the Looking Glass.

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,240
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,320
...is an indictment
of organized religion.

38
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,570
The Walrus, with his girth
and good nature...

39
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,700
...he obviously represents
either Buddha...

40
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,660
...or with his tusks, the Hindu
elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

41
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,750
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

42
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,590
Now, the Carpenter,
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,840
...who was raised a carpenter's son,
represents Western religions.

44
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,760
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

45
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,430
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,270
...then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

47
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,270
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,110
...that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

49
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,900
...destroys one's inner being.

50
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,110
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,110
...by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,410
...out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

53
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,450
...who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

54
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,460
...and says, "Do it...
Do it and I'll fucking spank you!"

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,880
Oh, Jesus!

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,590
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

57
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,970
What have I been doing
with my life?

58
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,470
- What am I...?
- Yeah, I know.

59
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,300
Listen, my advice to you...

60
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,100
...take this money you've
collected for your parish...

61
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,230
...go get yourself a nice dress,
you know? Fix yourself up.

62
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,610
Find some man, some woman, you
can connect with, even for a moment...

63
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,530
...because that's really all life is,
Sister, it's a series of moments.

64
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,820
Why don't you seize yours?

65
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,660
Attagirl. Attagirl.

66
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,340
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

67
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,210
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

68
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,090
You've been in his presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

69
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,510
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy.

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,930
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

71
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,770
Here's what I don't get about you.

72
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,770
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

73
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,360
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
Look at them.

75
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,530
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

76
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,530
...forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

77
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,870
See those two?

78
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,290
That guy doesn't know that the girl
cheated on him while she was away.

79
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,200
- She did?
- Twice.

80
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,460
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

81
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,880
...because they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

82
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,840
I like that.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,210
I wish they could all
feel that way more often.

84
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

85
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,970
You call me, you tell me
it's important, you know?

86
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,260
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

87
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,560
We're going home.

88
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,980
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

89
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,900
Take it and quit leering at me.
People will think I broke up with you.

90
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,370
- You did just say we're going home?
- Read.

91
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,410
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

92
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,040
And?

93
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,750
You have to keep reading.

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,000
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church"...

95
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,750
...is the kickoff of
a new campaign...

96
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,340
...which seeks to bring
Catholicism into the mainstream.

97
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,760
With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...

98
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,430
...of the century-old Jersey Shore
house of worship...

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,930
...will serve as a passageway
of plenary indulgence...

100
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,430
...a little-known Catholic belief
offering all that passes through it...

101
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,270
...a morally clean slate.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,520
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

103
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,150
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,610
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

105
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,370
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

106
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,160
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

107
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,330
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

108
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,080
What then, hell? Fuck that.

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,210
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

110
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,710
...and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,260
If we die with clean souls,
they can't keep us out.

112
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,470
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,850
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

114
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,140
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

115
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,810
He can't keep us out anymore.

116
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,230
Once we're back in,
he'll just forgive and forget.

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,190
But this thing, this is Church law.
It's not divine mandate.

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,860
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,370
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,000
...by the son of God
before he left was:

121
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,830
"Whatever you hold true on Earth..."

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,290
"I'll hold true in heaven."

123
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,340
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

124
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,130
This thing has a papal sanction...

125
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,170
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

126
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,970
...never yielded positive results.

127
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,640
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

128
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,680
Outstanding work!

129
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,600
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

130
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,770
This will help us get back
on his good side.

131
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,020
What?

132
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,980
I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

133
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,520
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

134
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,360
Creating an empire
out of simplicity."

135
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,320
I wanna hit them.

136
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,910
You really are
Just a simple creature.

137
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,450
We find a way back
and you wanna jeopardize that...

138
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,660
...because you yearn
for the good old days.

139
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,210
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

140
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,750
...thanks to you?

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

142
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,710
Killing spree?
I'm talking about divine justice here.

143
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm talking about raining down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

144
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,970
He's all about that.
I know he'd want this done.

145
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,640
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

146
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,390
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

147
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,350
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

148
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,060
If I'm wrong, which I'm not,
it's not gonna matter.

149
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,400
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

150
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,360
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

151
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,070
Well, he does hate competition.
I will say that.

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,410
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

153
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,540
Where is this church
we have to go to?

154
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,910
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,920
Last four days on Earth?

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,290
If I had a dick, I'd go get laid.

157
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,590
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

158
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,510
Let's kill people.

159
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,260
Oh, not you.

160
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,810
The Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

161
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,400
...will be holding its
biannual softball game...

162
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,070
...against the Cook County
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2.

163
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,490
Today's second collection
will be donated...

164
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,410
...to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

165
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,870
For those of you
who haven't followed the news...

166
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,870
...an unidentified homeless man
who was accosted...

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,210
...and severely beaten at
the New Jersey Shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,460
...lies in critical but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,300
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,880
...and police have had no luck
tracking down any possible family.

171
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,300
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,640
...to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,020
...asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,650
...join in this protest
against euthanasia.

175
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,150
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,660
We believe in one god,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,330
...maker of heaven and earth.

178
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,500
We believe in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...

179
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,370
Hey, choose life!

180
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,920
You're gonna burn in hell,
you fucking baby killer!

181
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,000
Holy shit, it's the pope.

182
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,260
Where?

183
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,670
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,640
Jesus. You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,810
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,770
You have an excuse. You're Jewish.
You don't know any better.

187
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,320
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,530
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,990
I went to church.

190
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,910
That still kills me, you and church.

191
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,540
If only they knew your tithing came
from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,250
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,920
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,300
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,800
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,010
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,480
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have babysat for in high school.

198
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,860
Well, the point is,
he told me something.

199
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,480
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,570
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,570
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,660
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it.

203
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,580
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,540
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,830
In more ways than one.

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,710
You need to get laid,
Bethany Sloane.

207
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,330
You need a man,
if only for 10 minutes.

208
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,210
My experience is that
the average male is never a man...

209
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,710
...not even for 10 minutes
in his entire life span.

210
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,720
That sounds militant.
You thinking ofjoining the other side?

211
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,720
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

212
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,930
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

213
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,930
I think God is dead.

214
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,440
The sign of a true Catholic.

215
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,280
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

216
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,080
I'm from the EPA.

217
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
We're checking on possible
Freon leaks.

218
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,460
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

219
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,250
Yes, we have central air.

220
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,920
In every room?

221
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,800
Except the bathroom. Why?

222
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

223
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,850
Move.

224
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,110
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

225
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,120
...than central air.

226
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,990
Pick that up.

227
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,290
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

228
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,260
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

229
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,180
...the powers will attempt
to contact the last scion.

230
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,390
I need you three...

231
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,640
...to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,810
Go.

233
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,480
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,310
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

235
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,060
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,230
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

237
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,610
Behold the Metatron!

238
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,410
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true...

239
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,710
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

240
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
Who the fuck are you and what
the fuck are you doing in my room?

241
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

242
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Stubbed my fucking...

243
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,100
Get the fuck out of here, now!

244
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,770
Or you'll do what exactly?

245
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,100
Hit me with that fish?

246
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,950
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

247
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,610
Jesus wept!

248
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,450
Look at my suit.

249
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,410
Take what you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

250
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,870
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

251
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,630
See?

252
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,050
I'm as anatomically impaired
as a Ken doll.

253
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,300
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

254
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,770
Honestly, you bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

255
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,600
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

256
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,270
What are you?

257
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,310
I'm pissed off is what I am.

258
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Do you drench everyone who comes in
here with flame-retardant chemicals?

259
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,070
No wonder you're single.

260
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,330
Stand back.

261
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,000
As I was saying...

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,300
...prior to your
fire-fighting episode...

263
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,850
...I am the Metatron.

264
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,350
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell.

265
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,600
You people.

266
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,860
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

267
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,860
I am a seraphim.

268
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,530
The highest choir of angels.

269
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,830
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

270
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,460
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

271
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,750
Any occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

272
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,550
...they're speaking to me.

273
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,880
Or they're talking to themselves.

274
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,050
Why doesn't God speak for himself?

275
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,270
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

276
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,770
...human beings have neither the aural
nor the psychological capacity...

277
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,070
...to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

278
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,650
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

279
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,570
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

280
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,490
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

281
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,500
What, aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

282
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,590
You want more proof?

283
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,300
Fine.

284
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,590
How about tequila?

285
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,260
Where the hell are we?

286
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,810
Only place you can go
for a good tequila.

287
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,060
Dos tequilas, por favor,
and an empty glass.

288
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,770
We're in Mexico?

289
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,440
Actually, we're in the franchised
Mexican eatery...

290
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,610
...down the street
from your apartment...

291
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,530
...but it's impressive nonetheless.

292
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,200
You don't mind I lost the wings,
do you?

293
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,290
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

294
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,120
What do you want with me?

295
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,630
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

296
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,960
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

297
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,380
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

298
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,430
And no one's asking you
to build an ark.

299
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,430
All you gotta do is go
to New Jersey...

300
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,060
...and visit a small church
on a very important day.

301
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,810
New Jersey?

302
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,110
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

303
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,650
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

304
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
What's the fine print?

305
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,820
Stop a couple angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

306
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,120
Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

307
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,370
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

308
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,500
...and thus negating all existence.

309
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,000
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

310
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,960
You might want to clarify that.

311
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,340
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

312
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,510
And his wrath was bore...

313
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,850
...by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

314
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,100
When Sodom and Gomorrah
was destroyed...

315
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,690
...that was Loki.

316
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,770
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

317
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,610
...that was Loki.
And he was good at what he did.

318
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,490
But one day he refused to
bear God's wrath any longer.

319
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,950
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

320
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,200
...a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

321
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,370
Grigori?

322
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,670
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

323
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,210
Guess what they do.

324
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,710
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

325
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,300
The Tenth Plague.

326
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,970
Tell a person you're the Metatron,
they stare blankly.

327
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,260
Mention something in
a Charlton Heston movie...

328
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,560
...and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

329
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,560
May I continue uninterrupted?

330
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,690
Once he's done with the firstborn...

331
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,440
...Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

332
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,860
And over many rounds...

333
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,070
...they get into
this discussion about...

334
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,070
...whether murder
in God's name is okay.

335
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,490
And in the end...

336
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,540
...Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

337
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,920
...and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

338
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,580
So...

339
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,420
...very inebriated...

340
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,130
...Loki tells God he quits...

341
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,510
...throws down his fiery sword...

342
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,550
...and gives him the finger.

343
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,760
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

344
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,930
...God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

345
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,520
Hence all the spitting.

346
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,020
So for their insolence...

347
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,020
...God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

348
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,740
...would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

349
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,610
- Were they sent to hell?
- Worse.

350
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,610
Wisconsin...

351
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,410
...for the entire span
of human history.

352
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,040
And when the world ends, they'll have
to sit outside the gates for eternity.

353
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,960
And this has what to do with me?

354
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,500
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

355
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,210
...that would allow them
to reenter heaven.

356
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,970
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

357
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,970
It's not that simple.

358
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,510
If they get in, they will have
reversed God's decree.

359
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,140
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

360
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,940
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

361
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,650
...functions solely on one principle:

362
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,780
God is infallible.

363
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,780
To prove him wrong...

364
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,830
...would undo reality
and everything that is.

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,790
Up would become down,
black would become white.

366
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,830
Existence would
become nothingness.

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,540
In essence...

368
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,090
...if they're allowed to enter
that church...

369
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,840
...they'll unmake the world.

370
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,850
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

371
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,850
Why doesn't God
do something about it?

372
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,850
He could. But he'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

373
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,610
Why me?

374
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,980
Because of who you are.

375
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,860
And who am I?

376
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,070
The girl in the P.J.'s!

377
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,870
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

378
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,990
I'm gonna have to pass.

379
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,040
I beg your pardon?

380
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,540
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

381
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,210
When my husband decided...

382
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,960
...he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear children...

383
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,170
...where was God?

384
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
To hell with him.

385
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,050
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

386
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,470
...just because of a grudge
against your creator.

387
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,980
So you lost the ability
to make life.

388
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,560
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

389
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,900
...by acting like one
and protecting it.

390
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,990
Saving it!

391
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,450
But I can't make you.

392
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,120
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

393
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,700
...and accept your responsibility...

394
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,660
...you won't be alone.

395
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,080
You'll have support.

396
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,250
What? More angels?

397
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,000
Prophets.

398
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,970
In a manner of speaking.
Two of them.

399
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,970
The one who speaks...

400
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,470
And he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not.

401
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,730
- will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

402
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,270
The other one...

403
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,020
...well, he's the quiet type.

404
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,360
Look, I've gotta go.

405
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,780
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

406
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,610
Hey.

407
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,450
- What's he like?
- God?

408
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,160
Lonely...

409
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,120
...but funny.

410
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,210
He's got a great sense of humor.

411
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
Sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

412
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,130
...than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

413
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,130
Sex is a joke in heaven?

414
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,010
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

415
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,390
I'll see you.

416
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,260
Snootch to
the motherfucking nootch!

417
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,850
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

418
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,390
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

419
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,650
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pubeless asses!

420
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,450
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

421
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,450
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

422
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,780
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

423
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,700
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

424
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,500
I don't know those kids,
but they would have kicked yours...

425
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,330
...and lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

426
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,210
Well, thanks for being
out here so late.

427
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,510
Wait a minute. Are you protestors?

428
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,590
You mean those dickheads with signs
and pictures of dead babies?

429
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,010
Shit, no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

430
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,140
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

431
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,180
But what are you doing
hanging around?

432
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,310
We're here to pick up chicks.

433
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,140
Excuse me?

434
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,360
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

435
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,190
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

436
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,200
Right.

437
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,030
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

438
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,910
- I think.
- Wait a second.

439
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,660
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

440
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,870
What the shit is that?

441
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,830
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

442
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,880
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

443
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,590
Now, how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

444
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,390
I'm going back to Jersey
and starting the business again.

445
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,220
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

446
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,810
Prophets. Two of them.

447
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,690
You know what I'm saying,
Silent Bob?

448
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,690
You gotta be kidding me.

449
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,400
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

450
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,110
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

451
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,700
Try it on.

452
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,870
It's a lot more compact
than the flaming sword...

453
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,990
...but it's not nearly as impressive.

454
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,370
It doesn't have that
"wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

455
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,580
How am I supposed to strike fear into
the hearts of the wicked with this?

456
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,750
Look at this.

457
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,510
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

458
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,510
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

459
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,890
You got to stand and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

460
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,890
I had to do all the work.

461
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,180
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

462
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,890
I rained down sulfur, man.
There's a subtle difference.

463
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,650
Okay, I'm sure.

464
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,610
Fuck you, man. Any moron with
a pack of matches can set a fire.

465
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,650
Raining down sulfur
is an endurance trial.

466
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,530
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can do...

467
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,200
...next to soccer.

468
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,410
I'll take this one.

469
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,300
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or you gonna do us both?

470
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,760
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

471
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,890
You're a man of principle.

472
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,600
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

473
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,150
Some fuck named John Hughes.

474
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,900
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?

475
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,150
You know that guy too?
That fucking guy.

476
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,990
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

477
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,070
There's tits in it, but no bush.

478
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,990
But Ebert here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

479
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,500
...because he's in love
with this John Hughes guy.

480
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,750
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

481
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,250
Fucking Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

482
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,130
Fucking Weird Science, where this
babe wants to undress and get down...

483
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,340
...but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

484
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,600
And then Pretty in Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

485
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,020
...because when the redhead
hooks up with her dream guy...

486
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,650
...he starts sobbing like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

487
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,980
And there's nothing worse
than watching a fucking fat man weep.

488
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,990
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

489
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,950
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

490
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,160
...where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

491
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,210
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fucking harsh.

492
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,540
But best of all...

493
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,750
...there was no one dealing, man.

494
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,170
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

495
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,880
...if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

496
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,880
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

497
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,050
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

498
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,060
There is no Shermer in Illinois.

499
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,060
Movies are fucking bullshit.

500
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,730
When are you going
to New Jersey?

501
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,150
Jeez, this broad asks
a lot of questions.

502
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,400
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

503
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah. So you do anal?

504
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,900
Is it true chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

505
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,910
I didn't ask you out for sex.

506
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,950
I'll take head.

507
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,910
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this...

508
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,420
...but I think I should go with you.

509
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,760
What, like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

510
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,510
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

511
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,390
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

512
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Really?

513
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
You're going to
lead me somewhere.

514
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,350
Me lead you?

515
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,310
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

516
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,570
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

517
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,740
Someone said I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I'm supposed to go.

518
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,780
What the hell are
you babbling about?

519
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,530
We saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarves...

520
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,410
...and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

521
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,080
Do you believe in God?

522
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,750
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

523
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,340
...and we get the Jesus freak?

524
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,130
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait.

525
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,930
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

526
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,340
Pay?

527
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,930
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

528
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,100
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

529
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,650
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

530
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,150
...and we're in that fucked-up bar!

531
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,740
What about sex?

532
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,150
No sex.

533
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

534
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,660
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

535
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,790
In that highly unlikely situation?

536
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,340
Yeah, sure.

537
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,510
Yeah? She's a slut.

538
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,430
All right.

539
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,930
But I get to drive.

540
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,320
What gear are you in?

541
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,780
Gear?

542
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,370
Well, what do I know
about shifting?

543
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,670
Like I ever drove before.

544
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,340
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

545
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,840
...New Jersey.

546
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,930
Maybe you're wrong
on the slaughter thing.

547
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,890
How can you be sure what incurs
the Lord's wrath these days?

548
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,230
Times change.

549
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,020
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a hell-worthy trespass.

550
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,610
The major sins never change.

551
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,440
And besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker...

552
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,740
...from, like, a mile away.

553
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,660
Bet on it.

554
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,620
This from the guy who still owes me
10 bucks over that bet...

555
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,910
...about which was gonna be the
bigger movie, E. T. or Krush Groove.

556
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,250
You know, fuck you, man,
because time's gonna tell on that one.

557
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,050
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

558
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,680
Insinuating, no.

559
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,390
Flat-out telling you.

560
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,430
Right there. Right there.
There's one.

561
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,730
So? They're kissing.

562
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,940
Adultery.

563
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,270
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

564
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,360
You are just a simple creature.

565
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,990
- Am I right or what?
- I happen to know the truth.

566
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,110
I'm not gonna tell. I wanna see
how boned up on the job you are.

567
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,950
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

568
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,740
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

569
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,120
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

570
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,960
Okay. Well, it's a good thing
you were never...

571
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,000
...the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

572
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,970
"No married man kisses his wife
like that"? Are you stoned?

573
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,130
Excuse me.

574
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,390
Are you married?

575
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,260
Why?

576
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,810
I'm just curious.

577
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,230
What do you think?

578
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,200
- What?
- To her?

579
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,320
- What?
- Are you married to her?

580
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,830
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

581
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,750
Why?

582
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,540
Whose house?

583
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,090
Run's house

584
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,800
I said, whose house?

585
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,800
Run's house

586
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,010
Whose house
Say what?

587
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,390
Run's house
Say what?

588
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,020
Martin

589
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,230
She's fucking pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

590
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,320
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

591
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,570
Let me know how she is.

592
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,490
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

593
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,660
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

594
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,910
...but being that I've decided to
go home, and not to New Jersey...

595
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,540
...sorry for the inconvenience,
and goodbye.

596
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,750
You're breaking up with us?

597
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,420
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

598
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,510
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

599
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,840
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

600
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,100
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fucking sky, you know.

601
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,730
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky, you know.

602
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,120
No heartbeat.

603
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,080
Think someone threw him out a plane
with a message on him...

604
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,630
...like in Con Air?

605
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,420
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

606
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,130
- Con Air? Con Shit.
- Kill it! Kill it!

607
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,300
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

608
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,470
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,810
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

610
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,770
Hey! What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

611
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,940
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

612
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,480
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

613
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,320
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

614
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,830
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand.

615
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,250
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find threads?

616
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,420
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

617
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,840
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

618
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,300
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

619
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,550
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

620
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,180
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

621
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,180
...the impact with which you hit
would have liquefied you.

622
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,020
Death is a worry of the living.

623
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,650
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

624
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,440
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

625
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,650
I died.

626
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,990
Christ told me the secret
to resurrection once.

627
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,610
We were at this wedding in Canaan.
And I got drunk and forgot it.

628
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,450
Wait, wait, wait.

629
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,410
Christ?

630
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,540
You knew Christ?

631
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,710
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

632
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,620
Let me guess.

633
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,210
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

634
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,130
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

635
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,840
At least I was a man.

636
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,090
Been dead nearly 2000 years.
Here, check this out.

637
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,390
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rocking the ganj.

638
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,640
It's not a joint.

639
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,020
I can't read this.

640
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,150
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

641
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,400
Freaked me out because he basically
told me when my number was up.

642
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,320
Took all the flavor out of
the remaining years. We gotta go.

643
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,030
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit.

644
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,700
I'm starving. Back off, Kato.

645
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,040
Wait a second!

646
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,880
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

647
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,920
...and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

648
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,050
...I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

649
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,510
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where you came from.

650
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,550
Me? I came from heaven.

651
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,100
Now let's start walking.

652
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,060
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

653
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,310
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

654
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,730
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

655
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,610
What the hell's an apostle?

656
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,560
Let me get this straight.

657
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,930
She's already met the prophets...

658
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
...and the apostle's with them?

659
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,320
I think that our best course
of action...

660
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,900
...is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

661
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,620
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

662
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,830
...well, I'm left with no choice...

663
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,040
...but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

664
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,500
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

665
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,010
I appreciate the loan.
You can have that back.

666
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,470
I remember when all we had
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

667
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,020
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

668
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,270
Now, how about you start
explaining things, like for starters...

669
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,770
...how did you find us?

670
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,190
You know what the dead do
with most of their time?

671
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,030
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

672
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,690
I can't wait to die.

673
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,610
And why are you watching me?

674
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,030
Because you're gonna help me
get changes made...

675
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,030
...in that book
you put so much stock in.

676
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,490
- Hustler?
- The Bible!

677
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,870
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

678
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,540
Neither are we. You don't
hear us bitching and moaning.

679
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,050
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th apostle.

680
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,720
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th apostle.

681
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,560
Yeah, but you heard of
the other 12 apostles.

682
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,230
Yeah, all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

683
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,850
And why is that?
Because I'm a black man.

684
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

685
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,530
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing the faith on.

686
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,160
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

687
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,410
I don't buy it.

688
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,660
If that's true, why did he get
written about and you were left out?

689
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,790
Well, he is the son of God.

690
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,250
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

691
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,080
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

692
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,750
Leaving me out's okay because you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

693
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,260
You gonna listen to this shit?

694
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,510
That's what the good people
of Antioch said...

695
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,390
...right before they stoned my ass.

696
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,600
You were martyred?

697
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,600
That's one way of putting it.

698
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,730
Another way is to say I was
bludgeoned by big fucking rocks.

699
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,600
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit:

700
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,940
Life eternal,
a place in God's heaven.

701
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,690
But as soon as you hear
you're getting this good shit...

702
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,400
...from a black Jesus, you freak.

703
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,700
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

704
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,450
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

705
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,910
Gonna eat that hash brown?

706
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,870
So you went to heaven?

707
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Damn right I went to heaven!
Shit, that's the least he could do.

708
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,710
In the three years I followed his ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

709
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,760
Hell, no. And I was in my prime.

710
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,470
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

711
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,140
...not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

712
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,140
She had a thing for dark meat.

713
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,270
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in heaven...

714
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,440
...I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as the message was right.

715
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,650
The message is what counts.

716
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,490
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

717
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,660
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

718
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,530
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

719
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,450
That's why I'm gonna help stop those
angels from getting into that church...

720
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,120
...in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

721
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,960
How do you know about that,
the angels?

722
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,170
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

723
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,510
When you were 5, you let a kid
from next door piss in your hand.

724
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,010
You did that shit? You're nasty.

725
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,600
I never told anybody about that.

726
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,350
Neither did he.

727
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,270
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

728
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,020
- His name was Brian Johnson.
- Brian Johnson.

729
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,270
See, your exploits,
no matter how inane...

730
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,360
...are well documented in heaven.

731
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,280
Probably hell too.

732
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,160
Where are you going?

733
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,040
Yo, man, tell me
something about me.

734
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,080
You masturbate more
than anyone on the planet.

735
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,040
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

736
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,550
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

737
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,840
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

738
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,890
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

739
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,560
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
if God even existed.

740
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,150
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

741
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,070
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

742
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,200
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

743
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,830
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

744
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,130
Where did those two assholes go?

745
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
What are you doing?

746
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,020
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

747
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,110
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

748
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,530
We gotta get moving.
How can we get to Jersey?

749
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,610
The train. I'll call for reservations.

750
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,380
I thought she looked familiar.

751
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,090
- Who?
- Serendipity.

752
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,520
Morning, shoppers.

753
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,360
Good morning.

754
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,700
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

755
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,660
- We creamed them.
- All right.

756
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,000
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

757
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,500
Do I smell onions?

758
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,260
Excuse me.

759
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,180
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

760
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,060
You may proceed, mon ami.

761
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,650
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

762
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,650
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

763
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,400
Oh, come on!

764
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,620
Would you just relax? I'm doing it.

765
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,870
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

766
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,330
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher, in 1989.

767
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,170
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

768
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,010
Broadcast nationally
as the Mooby Fun-Time Hour.

769
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,600
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

770
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,640
...16 records,
eight prime-time specials...

771
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:21,310
...and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

772
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,360
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

773
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,990
...dubbed "Mooby World."

774
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,410
Did I miss anything?

775
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,240
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

776
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,740
Damn it!

777
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,540
Now, is there a point to this?

778
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,370
You and your board are idolaters.

779
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,290
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

780
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,970
That's you.

781
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,430
Do you know much about voodoo?

782
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,180
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

783
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,980
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

784
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,060
...the most well-known of which...

785
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,650
...is the voodoo doll.

786
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,270
You see...

787
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,580
...a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

788
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,790
...to various pokes and prods.

789
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,000
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

790
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,630
- Call security, now!
- Yes, sir.

791
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,010
All lines are currently down.

792
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,470
- I have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

793
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,010
You're doing it again. Stop.
What did we talk about?

794
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,520
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

795
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,560
...which draws worship
from the Lord.

796
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,980
You have broken
the First Commandment.

797
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,030
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

798
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,860
...passes for a decent human being.

799
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,370
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

800
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,370
Like you, Mr. Burton.

801
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,960
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years eight times.

802
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,210
You even had sex
with her best friend...

803
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,630
...while you were supposed to
be home watching the kids.

804
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,220
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

805
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,380
Mr. Newman.

806
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,220
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

807
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,560
...and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

808
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,180
...to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

809
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,890
...just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

810
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,310
...when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

811
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,570
She killed herself
three months later.

812
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,570
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

813
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,570
Very compassionate, Mr. Brace.

814
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,740
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

815
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,160
...and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

816
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,080
...to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

817
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,880
Heavens.

818
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,670
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

819
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,430
...to have sex with
an 11-year-old boy.

820
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:56,550
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

821
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,390
...from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

822
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,890
...because it was, survey says...

823
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,190
...less costly.

824
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,270
You, on the other hand...

825
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,610
...are an innocent.

826
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,570
You lead a good life.

827
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,780
Good for you.

828
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,660
But you, Mr. Whitland...

829
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,700
...you have more skeletons in
your closet than this assembled party.

830
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,540
I cannot even mention them aloud.

831
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,010
You're his father, you sick fuck.

832
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,640
- Good.
- Not bad, right?

833
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,680
That's great work. Very good.

834
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,560
Well...

835
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,810
...alone at last.

836
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,440
With the exception of
Miss Pryce here...

837
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,320
...there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

838
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,150
Not one.

839
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,820
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

840
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,160
Fear.

841
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,330
And therein lies the problem.

842
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,330
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

843
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,830
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

844
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,170
...hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

845
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,840
...lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

846
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,220
But not from God.

847
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,350
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

848
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,020
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

849
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,860
Look, if I believed enough in this...

850
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,570
...I wonder...

851
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,720
Come on. I don't believe in voodoo.

852
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,720
Voodoo.

853
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,320
But I do believe in this.

854
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,780
Don't run! Don't run!

855
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,660
Fakes! Fakes! All of you, fakes!
Oh, and you!

856
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,410
"But I do believe in this."

857
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,910
What does that mean?

858
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,410
And one to grow on.

859
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,590
Gum?

860
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,550
Go on. It's okay.

861
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,680
You've done nothing wrong.

862
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,850
These guys were fakes.

863
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,260
You're a pure soul.

864
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,430
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

865
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,400
Loki!

866
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,440
You're getting off light.

867
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,940
- Loki!
- I know. I'm coming.

868
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,370
You're so lucky.

869
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,250
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

870
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,750
Three years this August.

871
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,460
Let me guess, 14th apostle, left out
of the Bible because she's a woman?

872
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:14,800
This girl's no woman.

873
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,880
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

874
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,680
What, these?

875
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,970
You should know better than anyone
here that tits don't make a woman.

876
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,430
The tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

877
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,020
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things:

878
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,810
Her legs.

879
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,320
But as you can see...

880
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,150
...I lack definition.

881
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,950
Hey, they're getting a free show!
Let me see that shit!

882
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,030
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

883
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,790
How do you know...?
How does she know Metatron?

884
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,830
This is the last scion.

885
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,870
You're kidding.

886
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,380
I'm confused.

887
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,510
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

888
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,300
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

889
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:06,140
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

890
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,770
I'm a muse, stupid.

891
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,440
I can't take much more of this.

892
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,190
So you, what, inspire people?

893
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,520
What just went down
with your friends there...

894
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,990
It doesn't take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

895
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,030
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

896
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,620
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

897
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,290
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

898
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,290
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

899
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,380
...burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

900
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,710
...I had nothing to do
with that one.

901
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:42,130
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to
get grosses up on that piece of shit.

902
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,860
What are you doing stripping?

903
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,370
You remember why I left?

904
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,870
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

905
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,080
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

906
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:15,080
I gave my two weeks' notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

907
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,210
...and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

908
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,920
So, what happened?

909
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,680
Writer's block.

910
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,590
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

911
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,720
I can inspire anyone I meet and give
out a zillion and nine ideas a second...

912
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,730
...but I can't keep any for myself.

913
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,730
Her quirky sense of humor.

914
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,020
- Whose?
- God's.

915
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,070
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there a doubt in your mind?

916
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,950
He's always referred to as "him."

917
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,660
Well, that's not how I wrote it.

918
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,950
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

919
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,620
...is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

920
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,790
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

921
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,380
...and all the penholders were men.

922
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,380
So she became a he.
Doesn't stop with God either.

923
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,510
The whole book's gender-biased.

924
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,800
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

925
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,090
A woman cuts Samson's
coif of power.

926
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,560
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

927
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,100
Read that book again.

928
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:14,310
Women are bigger antagonists than
Egyptians and Romans combined.

929
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,650
It stinks.

930
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,780
Why is the last scion here?

931
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,820
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

932
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:30,080
- Not the plenary-indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

933
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,750
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

934
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,080
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

935
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,670
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

936
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,340
I have issues with those who treat God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

937
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,760
...like some Catholics.

938
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,800
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

939
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:50,100
- If we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

940
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,100
No denomination's nailed it yet...

941
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,810
...because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

942
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,820
...that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, Just that you have faith.

943
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:04,320
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

944
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,280
Look, they made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

945
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,210
Who fucking farted?

946
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,880
Not born. Shit into existence.

947
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,140
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

948
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,720
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

949
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,060
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

950
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,520
A shit demon!

951
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,230
No man of woman born!

952
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,190
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

953
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,900
It came for Bethany!

954
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,900
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thing!

955
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,410
Damn! I knew I was gonna
whack somebody today!

956
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,410
Yo, get your fucking hand back.

957
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,740
Represent!

958
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,580
Go! Go! Go!

959
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,270
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

960
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,190
Over the bar! Come on!

961
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:36,120
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

962
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,170
The hill where Christ
was crucified?

963
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,040
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

964
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,630
Christ excluded, they were criminals.
Killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

965
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,880
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

966
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,470
...spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

967
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,390
...the result of which is
that walking pile of crap there.

968
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,560
The Golgothan shit demon,
hell's chief assassin.

969
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,440
And it's here for you, girlie.

970
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,110
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

971
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,690
- You the man.
- How?

972
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,150
"Knocks strong odors out."

973
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,780
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

974
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:50,950
What?

975
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,950
Whoever sent this might send more.

976
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,000
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

977
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,620
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

978
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,540
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

979
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,050
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

980
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,840
- Jersey's sold out, sir.
- What?

981
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,510
There's one same time tomorrow.

982
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,510
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State...

983
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,890
...and show up
two hours in advance.

984
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,600
Nice.

985
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,600
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

986
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:27,820
...what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

987
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,570
Bus, schmus.

988
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:34,240
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

989
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,740
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

990
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,410
Fuck, let's use them!

991
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,960
I wouldn't suggest that.

992
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,130
You see, kids...

993
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,920
...you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

994
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,390
Look at this pimp.
How'd you get out of hell?

995
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,680
I said I was coming up
on a routine possession.

996
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:01,060
I don't have much time. They figure
out my ruse, they'll come for me.

997
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,810
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You're inches from getting caught.

998
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,400
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

999
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,400
Don't you know what's going on?

1000
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,400
Well, we're going home.

1001
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,950
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into heaven?

1002
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,580
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

1003
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,580
Both sides. Above and below.

1004
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,960
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

1005
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,420
- Really?
- Why?

1006
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,670
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1007
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,630
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1008
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,970
...and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you might make him look bad...

1009
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,970
...by succeeding where he's failed.

1010
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:41,140
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1011
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:44,140
That's why you have to
travel incognito.

1012
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,270
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1013
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,320
Quit killing people.
That's high-profile.

1014
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,280
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1015
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,320
Oh, believe it, boys.

1016
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,780
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1017
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,620
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1018
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,660
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1019
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,670
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1020
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,000
Meanwhile, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1021
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,170
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1022
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,430
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1023
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,430
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1024
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,180
And remember, incognito.

1025
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,190
How you coping, kid?

1026
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,980
It's weird.

1027
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,650
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1028
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,990
...something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1029
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,620
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1030
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,370
You sound like the man.

1031
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,830
What's he like?

1032
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,460
He likes to listen to people talk.

1033
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,960
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1034
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,550
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1035
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,670
...he always had a smile
on his face.

1036
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,800
His only real beef with mankind...

1037
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:58,140
...is the shit that gets carried out
in his name.

1038
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,600
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1039
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:05,350
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1040
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,350
He said mankind got it all wrong...

1041
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,900
...by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1042
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,650
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1043
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,820
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1044
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:19,030
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1045
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,580
People die for it. People kill for it.

1046
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:24,080
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1047
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:29,290
...because of the Catholic beliefs
regarding this plenary-indulgence shit.

1048
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,750
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1049
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,670
...are exploiting that belief...

1050
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,380
...and if they're successful...

1051
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,470
...you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1052
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,560
All over a belief.

1053
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:47,770
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1054
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,900
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1055
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:54,400
...and he went flying through the air,
fucking crashed through the wall.

1056
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,820
It was fucked up.

1057
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,320
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1058
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:02,160
No. We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1059
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:05,540
...who just got on at the last stop.
This is Larry and Barry.

1060
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:06,960
- Hi.
- Hey.

1061
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,630
So Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1062
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,170
Hit this shit, man. It's good stuff.

1063
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,890
Oh, fuck.

1064
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,600
That's some bad shit, dude.

1065
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,640
You hit that?

1066
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,980
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1067
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,610
Bad shit.

1068
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,110
So why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1069
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,620
It's just this thing I have to do.

1070
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:45,160
We're going home.

1071
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh. Do you two live together?

1072
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,960
Unfortunately, yes.

1073
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:55,340
So how long have you two
been together?

1074
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,470
A while.

1075
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:02,260
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1076
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,930
How'd you meet?

1077
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,600
We were stationed together.

1078
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,020
See, that's beautiful.

1079
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:11,980
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1080
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,190
Pardon?

1081
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,530
There's all that macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1082
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,860
And you two meet there, hook up...

1083
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:25,040
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1084
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,540
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1085
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,710
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1086
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,460
- No.
- All right.

1087
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,710
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1088
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,380
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1089
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,050
I call it being dumped.

1090
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,090
I was...

1091
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,850
...dumped once.

1092
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,850
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1093
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,560
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1094
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:54,230
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1095
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,730
...and call you back.

1096
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,240
And they always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1097
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,410
When actually...

1098
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,200
...it hurts more.

1099
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,830
You know what we need?

1100
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,750
What do we need?

1101
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,330
We need drinks.

1102
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,880
We need a lot of drinks.

1103
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,420
Garçon.

1104
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,850
You're saying you still
go to church?

1105
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,100
Every Sunday.

1106
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,560
Does it...? I mean, does it
do anything for you?

1107
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,770
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1108
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,940
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1109
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,280
They go to church and feel bored...

1110
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:45,740
...but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1111
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,120
I am so buzzed.

1112
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,620
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1113
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:55,000
I remember the exact moment.

1114
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:01,300
I was on the phone
with my mother...

1115
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:05,430
...and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1116
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,310
This thing.

1117
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,480
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1118
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,480
...she said:

1119
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,440
"Bethany...

1120
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:20,820
...God has a plan."

1121
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:27,620
I was... I was so angry with her.

1122
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,250
I was like:

1123
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,250
"What about my plans?"

1124
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,170
You know?

1125
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,300
I had planned to have a family...

1126
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,010
...with my husband.

1127
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:43,090
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1128
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,850
Apparently not.

1129
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:56,230
How about you?
When did you lose your faith?

1130
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,570
A long time ago.

1131
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:03,150
One day God just stopped listening.

1132
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,610
I kept talking...

1133
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:07,780
...but I got the distinct impression
he wasn't listening anymore.

1134
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:11,200
How did you know she was listening
in the first place?

1135
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,120
Well, I guess I don't.

1136
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,210
I hate thoughts like that.

1137
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,630
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1138
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,800
Because when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1139
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,390
God's in heaven, and he's...

1140
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,940
She's always got her eye on you.

1141
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,320
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1142
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,660
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1143
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,090
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1144
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,340
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1145
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,760
All right, but I warned you.

1146
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,510
Okay.

1147
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,180
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1148
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,060
Really?

1149
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:18,560
Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.

1150
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:22,110
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1151
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,110
...from going into the church.

1152
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:27,860
They're trying...

1153
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,450
Shit.

1154
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,000
They're trying
to get back into heaven.

1155
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,580
See, they got tossed
out of heaven...

1156
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,710
...years ago, right?

1157
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,380
And if they get back in...

1158
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:46,300
...it proves God wrong...

1159
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:49,550
...and since God is infallible...

1160
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,390
...to prove her wrong...

1161
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,230
...would, you know,
unmake existence.

1162
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,650
May I have your attention, please.

1163
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:02,980
The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1164
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,650
I feel so stupid...

1165
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,740
...just saying it.

1166
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,490
The thing I don't get is, I mean...

1167
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,240
...how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1168
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:15,830
Two, even!

1169
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,250
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1170
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,470
Maybe you're supposed to
kill them.

1171
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:30,260
Oh, yeah, right. Kill them.

1172
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:35,350
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1173
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:39,850
...how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1174
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:47,110
I don't suppose it's much different
from killing a human.

1175
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:51,160
Where the hell is everybody?
I wake up and...

1176
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,040
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1177
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,120
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1178
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,460
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1179
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:06,300
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1180
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:08,630
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1181
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,300
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1182
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:15,220
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1183
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,230
Save it, lady. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1184
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,810
Loki!

1185
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,560
Holy shit. The apostle.

1186
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:23,730
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1187
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,020
What are you doing here?

1188
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,820
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1189
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,070
- She means us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1190
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,570
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1191
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,410
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1192
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,200
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1193
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:41,210
We're going home, okay?
No matter whose pride it may hurt.

1194
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,750
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1195
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,590
Are you high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1196
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,050
Fine. I'll kill her myself.

1197
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,430
What, I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1198
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,090
- These guys are fucking flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1199
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:04,770
Oh, shit!

1200
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,610
Jay!

1201
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,030
Biggie!

1202
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,570
The door! The door!

1203
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,620
Can't we talk about this?

1204
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,130
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1205
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,170
No ticket.

1206
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,510
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1207
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,760
Then you know who the chick was,
don't you?

1208
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,140
The scion, I imagine!

1209
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,020
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1210
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:24,270
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1211
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,360
And Azrael tells us we're marked?

1212
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,320
There's more to this
than we thought of.

1213
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,400
I was close.

1214
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:33,660
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1215
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:38,160
You know how I felt? Righteous.

1216
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:39,830
Justified. Eager, even.

1217
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,960
You all right?
Your eyes are kind of...

1218
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,170
My eyes are open.

1219
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,170
For the first time I get it.

1220
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:50,050
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1221
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:53,880
See, in the beginning it was
just us and him, angels and God.

1222
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:55,720
Then he created humans.

1223
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:58,810
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1224
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:02,140
...and bowing and scraping
and adoration.

1225
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,600
He gave them more
than he ever gave us.

1226
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,650
He gave them a choice.

1227
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:10,020
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore him.

1228
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,030
All this time
we've been down here...

1229
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,700
...I've felt the absence
of the divine presence...

1230
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:18,070
...and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1231
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,870
And why?
Because of the way he made us.

1232
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,580
Had we been given free will, we could
choose to ignore the pain like they do.

1233
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,380
But no, we're servants.

1234
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,460
Okay.

1235
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:33,050
You know, all I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1236
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,220
Wake up!

1237
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:37,050
Humans have besmirched
everything he's bestowed on them.

1238
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,050
They were given paradise,
they threw it away.

1239
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,560
They were given this planet,
they destroyed it.

1240
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,180
They were favored best
among all his endeavors...

1241
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,600
...and some of them
don't even believe he exists!

1242
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,770
And in spite of it all...

1243
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:53,570
...he has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1244
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,450
...at every turn.

1245
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,110
What about us?

1246
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,120
I asked you once...

1247
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:04,120
...to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1248
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,040
What was the result?

1249
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,380
Our expulsion from paradise.

1250
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,050
Where was his
infinite fucking patience then?

1251
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,960
It's not right! It's not fair!

1252
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,010
We've paid our debt!

1253
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:20,180
Don't you think it's time?

1254
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:23,180
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1255
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:29,810
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1256
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,570
Wait. Wait, wait. Kill them?

1257
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,400
You're talking about the last scion,
for chrissake.

1258
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,410
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1259
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:41,030
Don't. Don't, my friend.

1260
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,750
See, don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1261
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,330
They did me once.

1262
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,290
Scion or not...

1263
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,790
...she's just a human...

1264
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,000
...and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1265
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,170
No harm, no foul.

1266
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,180
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1267
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,100
What did you say?

1268
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:05,270
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1269
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:08,350
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking mouth!

1270
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,520
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1271
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,190
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1272
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,860
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1273
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,860
Well, fuck that.

1274
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:24,290
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the throne.

1275
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:27,370
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1276
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,670
We're going home, Loki...

1277
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,800
...and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty himself...

1278
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,800
...is gonna make that otherwise.

1279
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:44,810
Shit.

1280
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:49,560
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1281
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,400
Very basic strategy.

1282
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,900
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1283
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,070
Why are we enemies?

1284
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,530
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1285
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,990
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1286
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,750
I'm tired of
all this cryptic bullshit.

1287
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:09,410
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1288
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,710
...and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1289
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,170
...unless you come clean right now.

1290
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,340
Why me?

1291
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:20,930
Out of all the people on the
goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1292
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,310
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1293
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:29,190
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1294
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:32,860
How long would it take to come
to grips with something that huge?

1295
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,610
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1296
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:40,780
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly goes
from age 12 to 30. Twelve to 30.

1297
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,070
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1298
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,080
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1299
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,450
I'll tell you where.

1300
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:52,290
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1301
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,380
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1302
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:58,210
...to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1303
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:01,970
Oh, bullshit.

1304
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,050
Any important material
about Christ...

1305
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,720
...would give people
a better understanding of God.

1306
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:10,810
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with his family.

1307
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,940
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1308
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:18,280
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1309
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:22,700
Mary gave birth to Christ without
knowing a man's touch. This is true.

1310
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,700
But she did have a husband.

1311
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:28,490
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1312
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,160
...if he wasn't getting laid?

1313
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:33,670
The nature of God and the virgin birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1314
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:38,000
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1315
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,170
Meaning?

1316
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,170
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1317
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,970
...shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1318
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,800
...with the one you call Jesus.

1319
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:48,770
Bethany, you are...

1320
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:52,230
...the great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great...

1321
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,860
...great-great-grandniece
of Jesus Christ.

1322
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:03,780
So that would make Bethany
part black?

1323
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,500
I can't do this anymore.

1324
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:18,880
Bethany, where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1325
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,710
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1326
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,670
It's bullshit!

1327
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:28,430
Let her go, man.

1328
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,020
Give her time.

1329
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,360
Why?!

1330
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,360
What the fuck do you want
from me?

1331
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:44,820
I fucking hate you!

1332
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:47,410
I hate you.

1333
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,740
He can't hear you, you know.

1334
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,590
That's why we needed you.

1335
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,920
Why didn't you tell me?

1336
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,710
Would you...?

1337
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,550
Could you have believed me?

1338
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:07,850
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1339
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:11,560
Only after everything you've seen...

1340
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,350
...everything you've heard...

1341
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:18,400
...could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1342
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,070
I don't want this.

1343
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,780
It's too big.

1344
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,530
That's what Jesus said.

1345
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,700
I had to tell him.

1346
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,960
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1347
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,300
...not to be able
to tell the son himself...

1348
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,470
...because one word from his lips
would destroy the boy's human form.

1349
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:47,640
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1350
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,430
...who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1351
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,310
I had to tell this little boy
that he was God's only son...

1352
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,310
...and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1353
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,610
...at the hands of the very people
he'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1354
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,030
He begged me to take it all back.

1355
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,990
As if I could.

1356
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,490
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1357
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:17,000
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
it's something I've never told anyone.

1358
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,000
If I had the power...

1359
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,260
...I would have.

1360
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:25,170
It's unfair.

1361
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,930
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1362
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,310
...and to ask you
to do the same now.

1363
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:35,230
I sympathize. I do.
I wish I could take it all back.

1364
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:39,730
But I can't.

1365
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:44,030
This...

1366
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,360
...is who you are.

1367
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,830
Everything I am has been a lie?

1368
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,200
No, no, no.

1369
01:22:55,910 --> 01:23:00,460
Knowing what you now know doesn't
mean you're not who you were.

1370
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,340
You are Bethany Sloane.

1371
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,920
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1372
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,930
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1373
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,640
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1374
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,890
Be who you've always been.

1375
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,150
Just...

1376
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:24,190
...be this as well...

1377
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:27,990
...from time to time.

1378
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:34,490
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1379
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,830
To say the least.

1380
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,550
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1381
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,260
...a tad more habitable...

1382
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,390
...and a bit warmer?

1383
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,450
Fuck, man, I think this shit
Just kicked in.

1384
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:12,410
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1385
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:14,450
Going out in style.

1386
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,120
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1387
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:19,040
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1388
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:21,290
It's the voice of God.
Show some respect.

1389
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,790
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of him?

1390
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,130
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1391
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,970
- What?
- Come on. Didn't it ever occur to you...

1392
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:33,090
...that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of his control?

1393
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,930
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1394
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,980
You know those constitutionals
that he likes to take?

1395
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,310
"Constitutionals"?

1396
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,900
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1397
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,900
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1398
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,240
The Lord has a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1399
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,990
He assumes a human form
once a month and indulges.

1400
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,080
Doesn't say where he's playing,
just goes away for a couple hours.

1401
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,660
And he always gives his free points
away to neighborhood children.

1402
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,160
Isn't that sweet?

1403
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:03,830
But she hasn't come back from
one of these day trips, is that it?

1404
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,300
No, she hasn't...

1405
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,170
...and we've been
unable to locate her.

1406
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:12,590
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1407
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,010
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1408
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,190
Whomever has set
the renegade angels on their path...

1409
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,690
...and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1410
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,730
...is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1411
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,070
Were he to be killed
in human form...

1412
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,820
...he'd have returned
immediately to heaven.

1413
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:33,860
Someone knew enough...

1414
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,070
...to keep him biologically alive...

1415
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,120
...but incapacitate him
in another fashion.

1416
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:41,960
And as omnipotent
as we are above...

1417
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,500
...I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without his presence.

1418
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:47,500
We've looked everywhere for him.

1419
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:52,420
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind it.

1420
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:55,800
But whoever he is was clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1421
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,970
...as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1422
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,810
Could it be Lucifer?

1423
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,270
Not Lucifer.

1424
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,900
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1425
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,900
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1426
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:11,190
...because he has just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1427
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,740
So, what do we do now?

1428
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:15,660
Well, I say we get drunk,
because I'm all out of ideas.

1429
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:18,700
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1430
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:20,580
I beg your pardon?

1431
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,660
It's the guy in charge
of the church thing.

1432
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,340
Cardinal Glick?

1433
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,590
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1434
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,010
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1435
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,380
Good Lord.

1436
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:36,510
The little stoner's got a point.

1437
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:41,180
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
canceling the rededication ceremony.

1438
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:43,270
"We"?

1439
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,440
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I Can't Do This Anymore?

1440
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:54,110
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now, would I?

1441
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,080
Well...

1442
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,950
...the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1443
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,210
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1444
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,800
...but if we can let them know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1445
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,920
...we can win them back,
even get some new ones.

1446
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,590
Excuse me.

1447
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,260
Fill them pews, people.

1448
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:22,270
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1449
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,810
Hook them while they're young.

1450
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:29,060
- Kind of like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1451
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:32,280
We really appreciate you seeing us
so late in the day, Your Eminence.

1452
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,950
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1453
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:38,490
...about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1454
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:41,080
So you looking to help out
in some way, I take it?

1455
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,950
We'd like you to cancel
the ceremony.

1456
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,670
I beg your pardon.

1457
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:50,750
There's gonna be a world of trouble
if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward.

1458
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,670
Are you pro-choice?

1459
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,340
No, no. The trouble's not from us.

1460
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,760
It's from renegade angels that have
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1461
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,020
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1462
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,310
See, padre, it goes down like this.

1463
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,110
These guys think that
by passing through that archway...

1464
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:12,110
...they can go straight to heaven.

1465
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,820
You want me to call off
the ceremony for that.

1466
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:18,030
Who sent you?

1467
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,160
We were sent
by him who is called I Am!

1468
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:25,830
Cute. Really cute.

1469
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,290
Kids, playtime with the cardinal
is over.

1470
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:31,000
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1471
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:32,710
Your Eminence, it's not a joke.

1472
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,880
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1473
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:38,890
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1474
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:41,930
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1475
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,560
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1476
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:47,060
All right, mistakes were made.

1477
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:50,360
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1478
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,320
...responsible for
the oversights of old.

1479
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,150
I'm an important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1480
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,740
...so if you please...

1481
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:00,570
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1482
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,990
Do I make myself clear?

1483
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,750
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God himself...

1484
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:09,750
...is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1485
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,770
I can see the headlines now...

1486
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:34,770
...if there were gonna be any.

1487
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,440
"Existence Erased."

1488
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,780
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1489
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:41,200
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1490
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:44,870
What up?

1491
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,200
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1492
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:51,290
That's what he gets for messing with
our girlfriend. Cross-dressing fuck.

1493
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:54,170
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1494
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:58,470
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1495
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:01,760
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill them.

1496
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:03,970
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1497
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,310
They won't be killed.

1498
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,440
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1499
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:15,860
...right here, until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1500
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:19,650
Hey. There's only
one idiot here, Azrael...

1501
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,530
...and I'm looking right at him.

1502
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,160
Muse!

1503
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,620
Just in time to join us for a drink.

1504
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:33,170
Hey. Where'd you come from?

1505
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,960
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1506
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,550
Nothingness.

1507
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,340
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1508
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:46,010
All right, Plato, sounds like
you've had enough already.

1509
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,560
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1510
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:52,310
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1511
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,730
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1512
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,320
Is that who I think it is?

1513
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:58,690
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1514
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,530
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1515
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,780
Give me a...

1516
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:06,330
...Holy Bartender.

1517
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:08,290
Never heard of it.

1518
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:12,210
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1519
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,210
You do, don't you, Muse?

1520
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,380
Don't.

1521
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:19,210
Anybody? No?

1522
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:22,800
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1523
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,480
Get it?

1524
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,810
Sweet Jesus, Azrael! Why?

1525
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:38,400
Come on, demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1526
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:41,900
Oh, apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1527
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:45,030
...and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1528
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,240
The Christ bitch will join you.

1529
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,500
Are you really that stupid?

1530
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:54,080
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1531
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:56,540
I'm actually counting on it.

1532
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,920
And if my calculations
are correct...

1533
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:02,760
...the pawns are moving
into checkmate as we speak.

1534
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,270
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1535
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,560
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1536
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,270
...for coming here this morning.

1537
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,440
True, she's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1538
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:26,780
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1539
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:29,540
...hundred-years-young
house of God.

1540
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:30,910
God's house?

1541
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:35,000
God doesn't live here anymore.

1542
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:37,880
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1543
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,880
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1544
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:43,300
- He has abandoned you...
- Sorry.

1545
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,300
...his favorites,
to the whim of judgment.

1546
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,890
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1547
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:53,140
...prepare to taste God's wrath.

1548
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:54,520
Maybe we should just leave.

1549
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:56,350
You wanted your body count.
You got it.

1550
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,900
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1551
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:00,230
Officer McGhee.

1552
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:02,820
All right, mouthpiece...

1553
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:05,660
...let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1554
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,160
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1555
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:10,160
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

1556
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:12,080
Is that so?

1557
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,130
Ladies and gentlemen...

1558
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:23,670
...you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1559
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,180
...and this very day...

1560
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:30,010
...I assure you, you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1561
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,850
...in blood.

1562
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:34,180
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1563
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,350
Do it!

1564
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:39,270
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1565
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:44,360
He was kicked out.

1566
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:46,860
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1567
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:48,030
Then what happened?

1568
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,280
Yes, what?

1569
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:54,330
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1570
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,960
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1571
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,210
...the faithful and the renegades.

1572
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:02,130
Oh, the ethereal plains
were chaotic with battle.

1573
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:05,010
Angel against angel.

1574
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:08,510
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1575
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,470
But Azrael refused to fight.

1576
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,060
He remained in the middle, waiting
to see who came out victorious.

1577
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:16,230
What are you,
some kind of fucking chicken?

1578
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,730
No.

1579
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,730
I was an artist, stupid!

1580
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,440
I was inspiration!

1581
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,030
A muse has no place in battle.

1582
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,660
So after the fallen
were banished to hell...

1583
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,820
...God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1584
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:33,240
...and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1585
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:36,120
...something he considers
a great injustice.

1586
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:38,370
Oh, come on.

1587
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,500
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1588
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:44,340
No. It never bothered me.

1589
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,420
So you were an artist.

1590
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:48,260
Big deal!

1591
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:50,430
Elvis was an artist...

1592
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,850
...but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1593
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,850
That's why he is the king...

1594
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,850
...and you're a schmuck.

1595
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,100
Nice.

1596
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:01,060
So all this is about revenge.

1597
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:04,110
You're gonna unmake existence
because of a grudge against God?

1598
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,950
After the first million years? No.

1599
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:11,870
Escape from hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1600
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:16,450
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1601
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,040
...which it finally did...

1602
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,080
...in Catholicism.

1603
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,420
Plenary indulgence.

1604
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,380
But I couldn't exercise it.

1605
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,920
Demons can't become human.

1606
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:28,130
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1607
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,090
But angels can.

1608
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:33,640
Bartleby and Loki.

1609
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:38,390
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1610
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,270
...to celebrate their centennial...

1611
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:45,980
...and when it finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1612
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:47,990
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1613
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:50,150
...kept them cloaked
and off heaven's radars.

1614
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,410
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1615
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:57,290
...no soul in hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1616
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,330
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1617
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,920
...so I dispatched him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1618
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,420
Her. And how?

1619
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:09,090
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1620
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:12,090
Oh, no, I've seen way too many
Bond movies to know...

1621
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,100
...that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1622
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,600
...no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1623
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:21,850
The only X factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1624
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:27,320
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1625
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,280
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1626
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:37,450
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1627
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:41,460
...but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1628
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:44,500
Human, have you ever
been to hell?

1629
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:46,710
I think not.

1630
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,050
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1631
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,510
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1632
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,050
Still thinking only about yourself...

1633
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,060
...you fucking child!

1634
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,310
Now, now, now.

1635
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:04,190
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1636
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,820
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1637
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,900
Yo, put on Channel 9.
Davey and Goliath.

1638
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:14,660
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of current events.

1639
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:17,160
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1640
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:20,080
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1641
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,290
...have laid waste to St. Michael's!

1642
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,790
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1643
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,460
The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to their knees...

1644
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:30,920
...identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.

1645
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:33,890
Now, I'm not a man of faith,
but I'm inclined to agree.

1646
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:38,180
God, please, don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer! God, no!

1647
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,020
No!

1648
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:49,440
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1649
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:53,110
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not gonna matter anyway.

1650
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:02,210
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1651
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,870
What?

1652
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,460
Oh, nothing.

1653
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,710
I had something in my eye.

1654
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,550
Now who's the fucking child?

1655
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,930
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1656
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,350
Are you serious?
I'm a fucking demon.

1657
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:20,270
You'd have him assault me
with a putter?

1658
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,390
You want to play? Then we'll play.

1659
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,270
One side, Red.

1660
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:28,940
Go ahead, then. Pick it up.
Call it a gift.

1661
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,360
Come on.

1662
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:33,950
That's it.

1663
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:36,990
Take a shot.

1664
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,660
Take your best fucking shot.

1665
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:45,170
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1666
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:48,040
Come on, bright boy.

1667
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:58,300
Don't you know anything?

1668
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,700
Bethany, bless the sink!

1669
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:17,660
- What?
- Just do it!

1670
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:19,700
Bless the sink, damn it!

1671
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,190
That's what you get, motherfucker.

1672
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,900
But I'm a fucking demon.

1673
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,490
What just happened?

1674
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,200
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1675
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:06,670
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side will do the most damage.

1676
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:08,750
Holy shit!
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1677
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,750
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1678
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,920
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1679
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,180
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1680
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:20,890
Remind me to try the water-to-wine
thing at my next party.

1681
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,850
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about 10 miles.

1682
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,020
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1683
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:28,350
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1684
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,770
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1685
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:45,200
Oh, my God.

1686
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:00,640
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1687
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,970
Are we too late?

1688
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,640
To save these poor schmucks?

1689
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,520
Yeah.

1690
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:10,270
But we still exist.

1691
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,150
Where are they?

1692
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,730
They could already be
in the church.

1693
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,940
So if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1694
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,320
Are you fucking shitting me?

1695
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,320
The brother is gonna shred them
with his angel-be-good special...

1696
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,490
...ain't you, homey?

1697
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,660
If they pass through that arch,
they're clean.

1698
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:26,750
And if they die, they go straight up.

1699
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:29,250
And, hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1700
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,670
- Why don't they kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1701
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,670
Die with a mortal sin and you burn.
They don't wanna go to hell.

1702
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:38,510
Then what are we supposed to do,
wait for a solution to fall from the sky?

1703
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,100
Friend of yours?

1704
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,140
No, that was a cardinal.

1705
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:50,020
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1706
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:52,690
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1707
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,020
Don't you listen?

1708
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:57,110
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1709
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,450
He's been at it for a while now.

1710
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:01,200
Please! Please!

1711
01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:04,200
We ran out of parishioners...

1712
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:08,660
...so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping them.

1713
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:11,960
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1714
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,040
If only they'd let us jerk off,
you know?

1715
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,220
Take a step back.

1716
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,010
Let me go!

1717
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:27,390
Why? What are you trying to prove?

1718
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,890
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1719
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,360
Jesus Christ!

1720
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,570
I just wanted to go home.

1721
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,530
But him, you know...

1722
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:40,990
...he just lost it.

1723
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,240
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1724
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:45,830
He just snapped.

1725
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:49,500
And the funny thing is, this guy could
never even stand to see me work.

1726
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,710
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1727
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,250
Now look at him.

1728
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,420
This guy's fucking drunker
than hell.

1729
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:00,010
Which means he's human now.

1730
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:03,510
His wings have been cut off.

1731
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,600
Loki...

1732
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,930
Loki.

1733
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,980
The muse?

1734
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:14,190
Oh, no way!

1735
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,070
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific.

1736
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:19,280
What's with the tits? Can I...

1737
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,610
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1738
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:28,540
Tell me. Have you gone in and
come out through the archway yet?

1739
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,950
No!

1740
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:36,460
He's back.

1741
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,780
We were awaiting your arrival.

1742
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:04,910
Bartleby, wait. Stop. Listen to me.

1743
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:07,660
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1744
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:08,990
If you go back...

1745
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,700
I've become aware
of the repercussions.

1746
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:12,910
I know what I'm doing.

1747
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,000
You sick, twisted fuck!

1748
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:18,840
Bethany.

1749
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:25,340
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1750
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:28,350
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1751
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:31,520
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1752
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,100
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1753
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,350
And while you never see
your ex-husband...

1754
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,860
...or how blissful he is
with his new wife...

1755
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,030
And he is.

1756
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:49,950
- seeing you people every day on this
perfect world he created for you...

1757
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,700
...is a constant reminder...

1758
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:54,870
...that though my kind came first...

1759
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,630
...your kind was most revered.

1760
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,630
And while you know forgiveness...

1761
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,710
...we know only regret.

1762
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,550
The lesson must be taught.

1763
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,470
All are accountable...

1764
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:08,890
...even God.

1765
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,350
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1766
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:16,230
...just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1767
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:20,400
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1768
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:21,980
...will cease to be.

1769
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,650
No. Hey. Hey!

1770
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,240
No. No.

1771
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:28,240
I can't let you do that, Bartleby.

1772
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,410
This has gone too far.

1773
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,910
I might have to take you down.

1774
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,210
It's okay.

1775
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:39,920
I'll do it.

1776
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,590
My compatriot.

1777
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:50,470
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1778
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,850
He's weakened.

1779
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,350
You're weak.

1780
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,270
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1781
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,560
...a condition which carries
two liabilities.

1782
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,190
A conscience...

1783
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,440
...and...

1784
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:09,950
...a short life span.

1785
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,870
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1786
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:42,570
Oh, my God. He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1787
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:44,940
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1788
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,740
I can't believe this shit.

1789
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:50,490
We're on the brink of nonexistence
and God's still missing.

1790
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:53,620
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1791
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,630
What the hell are you doing?

1792
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,170
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1793
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:13,180
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1794
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,850
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1795
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:19,850
- ...or we can get making with the love.
- What did you say?

1796
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:22,020
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1797
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:23,650
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1798
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:30,360
That guy they won't take off
life support, John Doe Jersey.

1799
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:32,530
This is where he's at,
St. Michael's Hospital.

1800
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,540
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1801
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,290
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1802
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,830
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1803
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,880
- Have you been there?
- Once, with a chick.

1804
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,050
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1805
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,010
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1806
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:53,390
That's what I'm talking about.

1807
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:04,400
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1808
01:48:04,570 --> 01:48:06,650
Bob, come with me. Come on!

1809
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:09,400
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1810
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:11,740
I already did, but it takes two of us!

1811
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:14,830
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1812
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:16,660
This is the apocalypse.

1813
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:19,500
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1814
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,330
Thank you.

1815
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:38,390
Hey, Big Bird!

1816
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:40,940
Ready for the counting game?

1817
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:42,690
No!

1818
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,690
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1819
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:17,810
No more bullets.

1820
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:20,100
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1821
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:23,100
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1822
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:25,270
You just did him a favor, stupid!

1823
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:14,700
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1824
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:58,240
Oh, Bartleby.

1825
01:50:58,410 --> 01:51:01,990
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1826
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,160
Bow down, stupid!

1827
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:24,680
I'm sorry.

1828
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:50,210
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1829
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:54,090
...would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1830
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,220
What the fuck?

1831
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:04,390
Thank you.

1832
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:38,180
It never ends!

1833
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,990
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1834
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:02,530
What the fuck is this shit?

1835
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:04,330
Who the fuck are you, Lady?

1836
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:06,870
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1837
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,870
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1838
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,880
What the fuck is this, The Piano?
Why ain't this broad talking?

1839
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:18,340
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1840
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:21,680
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fucking nuts?

1841
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:24,720
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head? I want some...

1842
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:44,030
Where was she?

1843
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,660
Imprisoned in a body.

1844
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:50,170
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1845
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:52,750
Hang on a minute.

1846
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:29,200
You missed a bit.

1847
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,630
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1848
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:36,130
You ready to make those changes
I been talking about?

1849
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:39,050
We'll see. Muse?

1850
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:41,680
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1851
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,050
...you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1852
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:47,010
First I gotta say goodbye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1853
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:48,600
Oh, no.

1854
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:12,290
Metatron, is she...?

1855
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:14,670
Afraid so.

1856
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:18,710
One of the drawbacks to being
a martyr is that you have to die.

1857
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,840
But no matter.

1858
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:33,270
All is being taken care of.

1859
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,730
How so?

1860
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:39,650
Wax on, wax off.

1861
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:04,300
How did I...?

1862
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:06,050
She can rebuild you.

1863
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,720
She has the technology.

1864
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:11,890
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1865
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,230
That's...

1866
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:23,070
A very relieved deity.

1867
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:27,160
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come around.

1868
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:29,660
Your kind always does.

1869
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:33,330
So you might wanna
take good care of yourself.

1870
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:36,170
We're gonna need you
down the road.

1871
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:39,210
I know. I'm the last scion.

1872
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:44,510
Well, you're half right.

1873
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:47,590
You were the last scion.

1874
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:51,100
But now...

1875
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:53,350
...this...

1876
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:56,100
...is the last scion.

1877
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:01,150
I'm pregnant?

1878
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:05,610
Can't put anything past you.

1879
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:11,450
Take care of that parcel for us.

1880
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:15,460
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1881
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:28,930
Thank you for...

1882
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,970
...I don't know...

1883
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,310
...everything.

1884
01:57:36,150 --> 01:57:39,480
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1885
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:41,650
...most of it questioning
your great plan...

1886
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,650
...and that'd be arrogant of me,
I know.

1887
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:46,570
But there is one I need to ask.

1888
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:50,280
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1889
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:54,160
Why are we here?

1890
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:13,770
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1891
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:23,190
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1892
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,110
It was an honor.

1893
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:34,080
You did so well.

1894
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:41,290
I told you she was a woman.

1895
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,590
She's not really a woman.

1896
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,130
She's not really anything.

1897
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:50,390
She's something, all right.

1898
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:53,310
Crisis of faith over?

1899
01:58:53,470 --> 01:58:56,310
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1900
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,310
When it rains, it pours.

1901
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,690
Are you saying you believe?

1902
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:03,900
No. But I have a good idea.

1903
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:05,650
Yes.

1904
01:59:09,490 --> 01:59:11,280
The man was right about you.

1905
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:14,450
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell him so.

1906
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:17,250
And if you clean up your language...

1907
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:19,750
...I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1908
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:21,830
Thanks.

1909
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,920
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1910
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,050
Rufus.

1911
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:58,910
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1912
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,630
You guys wanna
hear something sick?

1913
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:08,630
- I got half a stalk when she kissed me.
- Jay!

1914
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,130
I couldn't help it. The bitch was hot.

1915
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:15,760
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1916
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:17,390
You're pregnant?

1917
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:22,520
Yo, I heard pregnant women can
have sex into their third trimester.

1918
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:24,610
I'll keep that in mind.

1919
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:08,530
So that would make Bethany
part black?
