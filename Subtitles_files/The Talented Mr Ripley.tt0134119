00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,212
<i>If I could just go back.</i>

2
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,716
<i>If I could rub everything out,</i>

3
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,843
<i>starting with myself.</i>

4
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,431
<i>Starting with borrowing
a jacket.</i>

5
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,383
- Frances, that was lovely.
- I'm so glad. Thank you.

6
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,220
Congratulations.

7
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,972
Marvelous.
Most enjoyable.

8
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,517
Herbert Greenleaf.
My wife, Emily.

9
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,018
Thank you.
Tom Ripley.

10
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,437
- How do you do?
- You were at Princeton.

11
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,398
Most likely you'll know our son,
Dick. Dickie Greenleaf.

12
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>I couldn't help
noticing your jacket.</i>

13
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,236
Yes.

14
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,364
Class of '56.

15
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,283
How is Dickie?

16
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,702
<i>We've enjoyed meeting you.</i>

17
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,288
I do hope that you'll
come out and see us.

18
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,375
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Both of you.

19
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,586
- Herbert?
- Yes, yes. I very much hope so.

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,840
Of course, Dickie's idea
of music is jazz.

21
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,259
- Oh, dear.
- He has a saxophone.

22
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,303
To my ear,
jazz is just noise.

23
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,514
Just an insolent noise.

24
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,559
- Very nice to meet you.
- And you.

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,519
- Sir.
- We'll see you at the shipyard.

26
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,521
- I hope to.
- Good.

27
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,400
I have to run!
I'm very late!

28
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,238
- Ah, you were great!
- You were great.

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,032
Darling couple,
aren't they?

30
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,119
Yes, they are.
Exceptional young man.

31
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,582
- Thanks a lot for the jacket.
- Thanks for filling in for me.

32
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,750
Take care of that wrist.
Bye, Fran.

33
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,261
Believe me.
Buy I.B.M. now, before it splits.

34
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,263
You'll make yourself
a fortune.

35
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,265
You think so?

36
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,470
Sorry.
Sorry.

37
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,515
Sorry.

38
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,935
<i>Youve probably
heard Dickie's been living in Italy.</i>

39
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,729
Mongibello.
South of Naples.

40
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,023
No kind of place
at all.

41
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,025
- Good morning, sir.
- Frank.

42
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,445
Marge,
his young lady,

43
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,697
is supposedly writing
some kind of book.

44
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,699
God only knows
what he does.

45
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,787
By all accounts, they spend the whole
time on the beach or in a sailboat.

46
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,332
That's my son's talent--
spending his allowance.

47
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,752
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom?

48
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,130
Persuade my son
to come home?

49
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,592
<i>I'd pay you...</i>

50
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,595
a thousand dollars.

51
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,434
Well, I have always wanted
to go to Europe, sir, but--

52
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:13,355
Good. Now you can go
for a reason.

53
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,165
Count Basie.

54
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,501
<i>Duke Ellington?
I don't know.</i>

55
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,881
I don't know.

56
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,135
I don't know.

57
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,560
Dizzy Gillespie.

58
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,024
My funny Valentine.

59
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,114
I don't even know
if this is a man or a woman.

60
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,259
Charlie Parker?

61
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,179
Charlie Parker.
I know it. It's Bird.

62
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,017
Yes!

63
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,019
<i>Ugh.</i>

64
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,502
- Here. I'll take it.
- Thanks.

65
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,712
That thousand bucks
should come in handy.

66
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,756
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get that.

67
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,057
- Thank you.
- Sir. You're gonna have a great trip.

68
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,018
<i>Mr. Greenleaf is personal
friends with the Cunard people.</i>

69
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:24,486
I can tell you, the Greenleaf name
opens a lot of doors.

70
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,360
<i>- Do you speak English?
- What you name, please?</i>

71
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,696
<i>- Ripley.
- Follow me. No problem.</i>

72
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,657
- Here, Signor Ripley.
- Okay.

73
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,785
Uh, there.
That one.

74
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,954
- This one.
- Wait, is that all? Count them.

75
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,166
<i>Attenzione.
Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley?</i>

76
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,503
- Si.
- Attenzione.

77
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,354
- What's your secret?
- Excuse me?

78
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,565
No, its just that--
You are American, aren't you?

79
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,734
No, its just that--

80
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:50,364
I have so much luggage,
and you're so, um, streamlined.

81
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,824
It's, you know,
humiliating.

82
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm Meredith,
by the way.

83
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:01,500
- Hello, I'm Dickie.
- Meredith Randall.

84
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,670
- Um, Dickie Greenleaf.
- Hello.

85
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,675
You're not
the shipping Greenleafs.

86
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,094
Oh, trying not to be.

87
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,846
Trying to jump ship.

88
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,432
So, uh, did they put
your cases in the wrong pile?

89
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,603
Its just that, uh,
you were in the "R" stand.

90
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,858
I thought
I saw you there.

91
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,902
My father wants me
back in New York.

92
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,780
He builds boats.
I'd rather sail them.

93
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,408
So I travel
under my mother's name.

94
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,870
- Which is--
- Emily.

95
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,122
I'm just kidding.

96
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,625
You know,
the funny thing is,

97
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,211
I'm not Randall either.

98
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,339
I'm Logue.

99
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,426
- As in--
- As in the textile Logues.

100
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,304
Trying to
shrug off the dress.

101
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,472
- I travel under my mother's name too.
- Randall.

102
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,516
Right.

103
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,644
- So, Rome, Rome, Rome.
- Oh.

104
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:08,066
- We're partners in disguise. Bye.
- Bye.

105

I promise.

110
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,344
Its just been too hot.

111
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,814
If I make dinner at my place tonight,

Dickie Greenleaf?

Tom Ripley?

115
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,159
- We were at Princeton together.
- Okay.

116
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,037
Did we know each other?

117
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,790
Hello.
Well, I knew you, so...

118
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,834
I suppose
you must have known me.

119
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,379
Princeton's like a fog.

120
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,882
America's like a fog.

121
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,261
This is Marge Sherwood.
Tom-- Sorry, what is it?

122
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,804
- Ripley.
- How do you do?

123
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,266
How do you do, Marge?

Nothing much.

- Yeah.

128
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,236
You're so white.

129
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,157
Did you ever see a guy
so white, Marge?

130
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,201
Gray, actually.

131
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,787
Its just an undercoat.

132

- You know, a primer.

You should come and have lunch
with us before you go.

137
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,722
- Yes, Dickie?
- Sure, anytime.

138
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,224
Well,

151

I know. I'm late.
I'm a swine.

152
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,147
- It's 4:00.
- I just woke up.

153
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,691
- Ohh.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

154
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,444
- You just woke up.
- Fausto and I took the boat out.

155
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,156
We were fishing, and then it was dawn,
and we caught absolutely nothing.

156
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,410
Mmm, yes, well,
we ate everything without you.

157
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,579

- Yes.

- Tom. Hello.
- Hi.

160
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,423
-Hello.
-How are you? Thought you'd disappeared.

161
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,468
- We were gonna send out a search party.
- No.

162
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,722
- No, still here.
- Tom was telling me about his journey.

163
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:34,768
<i>Made me laugh so hard
I almost got a nosebleed.</i>

164
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,438
- Is that good?
- Shut up.

165
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,483
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,152
I'm despicable.
But I love you.

167
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:47,155
- Do you love me? Do you love me?
- I'm intruding.

168
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,741
Can you mix
a martini?

169
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,080
- Sure.
- I'll do it.

170
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,083
- Ohh.
- I make a fabulous martini.

171
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,258
Everybody should have
one talent. What's yours?

172
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,427
Forging signatures,

173
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,555
telling lies, impersonating
practically anybody.

174
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,726
That's three. Nobody should have
more than one talent.

175
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,062
<i>Okay,
do an impression.</i>

176
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,648
- Now?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,818
The only talent my son has...

178
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,362
<i>is for cashing
his allowance.</i>

179
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,867
- What?
- Oh, I like to sail.

180
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,869
Believe me,
I love to sail.

181
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,913
- Instead, I make boats.
- Stop!

182
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,373
- Other people sail them.
- It's too much!

183
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,417
You're making all the hairs
on my neck stand up.

184
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,879
Oh, yes. Jazz.
Oh, jazz. Let's face it.

185
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,508
Its just, uh--
Its just insolent noise.

186
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,593
I feel like he's here.

187
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,096
- Horrible, like the old bastard's here.
- Good.

188
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,057
That's brilliant.

189
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,809
Brilliant!
How do you know him?

190
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,686
Oh, I met him in New York.

191
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,980
Marge!
Marge, this is scary.

192
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,358
You've got to hear this.
Meet my father,

193
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,610
Herbert Richard Greenleaf I.

194
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,572
Pleasure to meet you.
Dickie's made a fine catch.

195
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,200
- Uncanny!
- I know Emily thinks so.

196
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,536
- I don't get it.
- It's uncanny.

197
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,705
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom,

198
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,750
<i>and, uh, bringing him back?</i>

199
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,002
- What?
- I'd pay you.

200
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,004
If you would go
to Italy,

201
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:30,050
persuade my son to come home,
I'd pay you a thousand dollars.

202
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,721
<i>Im never going back.</i>

203
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,474
To actually hire somebody
to come all the way here...

204
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,476
to drag me back home--

205
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,687
Got to be a little
insane, doesn't he?

206
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,273
Ciao, Fausto.

207
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,779
- This is Tom.
- Ciao, Tom.

208
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,576
- I'm never going back.
- No, I think--

209
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,619
Your mother, her illness,
I think that's--

210
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,747
It's got nothing to do
with my mother.

211
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,501
She's had leukem--
This is what makes me boil about him.

212
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,172
He wants me back.
He wants me back.

213
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,632
- It's got nothing to do with my mother.
- Look, I don't know--

214
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,634
Go back.
Go back to New York.

215
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,761
Or call him, if you can find
a telephone that works,

216
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:19,308
and tell him wild horses wouldn't
drag me back to him or his shipyard.

217
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,771
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.

218
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,149
Marge, Tom's saying good-bye.

219
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,276
Oh, I'll come down.

220
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,197
So, uh, did you
speak to my father?

221
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh, you were right...
about the telephones.

222
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,493
- I told you.
- There are no lines.

223
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,329
- There's some problem.
- That's Italy.

224
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,168
Tom. You're off?
What are your plans?

225
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,670
Oh, back, I suppose,
as slow as I can. Oh!

226
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,424
This bag!

227
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:57,012
Hey.
You like jazz.

228
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,764
I love jazz.

229
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,268
This is the best.

230
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,438
Baker, Rollins.

231
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,691
Marge says she likes jazz,
but she thinks Glenn Millers jazz.

232
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,735
- I never said that!
- Bird.

233
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,071
Thats jazz.

234
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,448
Bird? Ask me
the name of my sailboat.

235
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,492
I don't know. What's the name
of your sailboat?

236
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,744
<i>Look! Look!
Bird!</i>

237
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:23,539
<i>Which is ridiculous. Boats are female.</i>

238
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,000
Everyone knows you can't
call a boat after a man.

239
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,212
- He's not a man. He's a god.
- Okay, we're going to Naples.

240
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,881
<i>There's a club--
It's not a club, it's a cellar.</i>

241
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,884
<i>- It's vile.
-Yes, it's vile. You don't have to come.</i>

242
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,595
It's great. It's-- It's great.
You're gonna love it.

243
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,921
How are you?

244
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,967
Oh!

245
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,798
That'd be cool.
Bring him up.

246
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,055
Tom Ripley!

247
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,559
Come on!
Get on up here!

248
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,397
Yeah!

249
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,567
I'll tell you when
to join the chorus.

250
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,611
Come on.

251
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,997
Okay.
Together!

252
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,372
<i>I bumped into
an old friend from Princeton,</i>

253
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,958
a fellow called Tom Ripley.

254
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,795
<i>He says he's going to haunt me
until I agree...</i>

255
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:21,216
<i>to go back to New York...</i>

256
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,719
with him.

257
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,809
Afternoon.

258
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,853
What time is it?

259
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,855
- Oh, God.
- "Go back to New York with him."

260
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,984
- Here--
- You always type your letters?

261
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,323
- That should be two T's.
- I can't write, and I can't spell.

262
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,326
It's the privilege
of a first-class education.

263
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,453
Your room's
upstairs at the back.

264
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,164
I think Ermalinda
made up the bed. Ermalinda!

265
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,794
- This is so good of you.
- Don't say it again.

266
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,843
Now that you're a double agent
and we're going to string my dad along,

267
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,679
what if we were to buy
a car with your expense money?

268
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,015
- Okay.
- Great.

269
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,184
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

270
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,561
Marge, Marge,
what do you think?

271
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,813
Little Ciquencento
with my dad's money?

272
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,733
Oh, please, Dickie.
You can't even drive a car.

273
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,153
- You can't even drive.
- What we need urgently is an icebox.

274
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,948
What do you think? Agree with me,
and I'll be your friend for life.

275
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:30,661
- I absolutely agree with Marge.
- Hmm.

276
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,163
Icebox. Icebox.

277
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,553
<i>So, what, is he gonna move in with you?</i>

278
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:52,307
It'll just be for a little while.
He can be-- He makes me laugh.

279
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,894
<i>- Okay, darling.
- Promise you'd say?</i>

280
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:59,815
- No, I like him.
- Marge, you like everybody.

281
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,609
<i>Don't like you.</i>

282
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,195
<i>Then I'll go to your place
and you can move in with Tom.</i>

283
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,456
I like him.

284
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,210
Marge, you like everybody.

285
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,384
No, I like him.

286
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:32,306
Marge, you like everybody.

287
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,893
<i>Now you'll find out why Miss
Sherwood always shows up for breakfast.</i>

288
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,604
It's not love.
It's my coffee machine.

289
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,398
<i>Ever since Ermalinda
showed him how to make his own espresso,</i>

290
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,734
<i>he feels like quite
the grownup.</i>

291
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,570
<i>- I bought the coffee machine.
- Oh, darling, is that for me?</i>

292
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,947
This is for Tom,
because he didn't complain.

293
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,867
<i>That ring is superb.</i>

294
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,411
Oh, Tom, I love you.
See?

295
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:59,500
Ooh! I had to promise,
capital "P," never to take it off.

296
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,920
- Otherwise, I'd give it to you.
- Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.

297
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,547
I had to bargain for it
for about two weeks.

298
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,050
I hope it wasn't cheap,
Marge.

299
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,053
Oh, it was.

300
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,723
I have to get a birthday present for
Frances, so perhaps you could help me.

301
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,643
- Who's Frances?
- My fiancée.

302
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,521
Engaged?
You're a dark horse, Ripley.

303
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,523
- Who is she?
- Your parents met her.

304
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:26,485
Oh, God.
Oh, I can just imagine.

305
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,779
"If only Dickie
would settle down.

306
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,906
Doesn't every parent
deserve a grandchild?"

307
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,826
<i>Oh, God.
Never. Never.</i>

308
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:38,455
I swear on your ring, Marge,
I'm never going back.

309
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,041
- Say when to pull.
- Pull now. Pull.

310
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:44,962
It's not pulling.
I'm doing it wrong.

311
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,132
- Better now, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

312
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,134
We'll make a sailor
of you yet.

313
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,554
You're doing really well.

314
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,849
- All right. Bar's open.
- Yes, please.

315
00:25:56,932 --> 00:26:00,060
- Hey, can we sail to Venice?
- Sure. I love Venice.

316
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,857
"See Venice and die."
Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?

317
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,985
- Is it Rome?
- I have to see Venice.

318
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,905
You do something and die, don't you?
Okay. Venice is on the list.

319
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,533
And Rome.

320
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,660
Do you ski?

321
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,665
Ah, no, no.
Don't tell me.

322
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,002
You're a lost cause.
That's the next thing to deal with.

323
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,713
<i>Christmas, were planning
a skiing trip to Cortina.</i>

324
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,175
- Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge.
- Yes?

325
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,927
<i>Unbelievable.
Tom can't ski either.</i>

326
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,181
- We'll have to teach him that too.
- Thank you.

327
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,477
<i>Such low class, Marge.
Does this guy know anything?</i>

328
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,813
Good thing we're not
getting married soon.

329
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,608
We'd have to invite Tom
on our honeymoon.

330
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,822
<i>Oh, I hated New York.
That whole Park Avenue crowd.</i>

331
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,866
<i>So I fled to Paris
to work on my book.</i>

332
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:59,036
And I was always going
to this cafe in Monmartre...

333
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,079
with Jean-Jaques.

334
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,708
And Dickie would play
"My Funny Valentine."

335
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:10,088
<i>It was only later that I found out
he only knows about six songs.</i>

336
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,508
Anyway, I looked forward
to seeing him, I suppose.

337
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,621
Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!

338
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:46,333
<i>You're not at my place by 7.:00,
Tom and I are running off together.</i>

339
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,211
- Okay, fine.
- Oh, Dickie!

340
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:02,057
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

341
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,395
Silvana, Silvana

342
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,397
You make me smile

343
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,608
I need
to talk to you.

344
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,868
- You're breaking my ribs!
- What?

345
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,247
You're breaking my ribs!

346
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,877
Ohh!

347
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,924
I could fuck this icebox,
I love it so much.

348
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,221
So, what did you actually
do in New York?

349
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,057
Played piano in a few places.
I told you.

350
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,185
Well, that's one job.
You told me a lot of jobs.

351
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,771
Few places.
That's a few jobs.

352
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,898
The mysterious Mr. Ripley.

353
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,817
Marge and I spend
hours speculating.

354
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:39,154
Anyway, I don't even want
to think about New York.

355
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,782
Are you ready?

356
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:46,036
- Cold beer. Thank you, Dad.
- Okay.

357
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,205
Copy out from here.

358
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:53,168
- You bring this with you to Europe?
- You gonna write something?

359
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,463
<i>I love the fact that you brought
Shakespeare with you but no clothes.</i>

360
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,925
Ermalinda says you wash out the same
shirt every night. Is that true?

361
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,927
No. I have more
than one shirt.

362
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,179
She can do that for you.

363
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,890
Anyway, just wear
some of my stuff.

364
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:09,393
<i>Wear anything you want.
Most of it's ancient.</i>

365
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,689
Now your signature.

366
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,528
Not Dickie.
Your signature.

367
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,499
Without the glasses,
you're not even ugly.

368
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:37,880
I don't need them
because I never read.

369
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,758
- How do I look?
- Like Clark Kent.

370
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:47,598
- Now Superman.
- Superman.

371
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,688
- Okay.
- I know.

372
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,568
<i>- It's like a kid's.  - See this, the "S"
and the "T"? Fine, vulnerable.</i>

373
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,696
That's pain.
That's secret pain.

374
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,657
Well, that must be a very deep secret,
'cause I don't know about it.

375
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:09,036
Hmm. There's nothing more
naked than your handwriting.

376
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,830
See how nothing's
quite touching the line?

377
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:15,375
- That's vanity.
- Well, we certainly know that's true.

378
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,051
Do you have any brothers?

379
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:27,095
No.

380
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,264
<i>No brothers,
no sisters.</i>

381
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,977
Me neither.

382
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,230
Nor does Marge.

383
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,609
All only children.

384
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,742
What does that mean?

385
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,413
Means we've never
shared a bath.

386
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,295
And I'm cold.
Can I get in?

387
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,220
No.

388
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,142
I didn't mean
with you in it.

389
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,608
<i>Okay.</i>

390
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,279
Get in. I'm like
a prune anyway.

391
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,094
It is me.
It's an old picture.

392
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:53,182
Every time! "Is it you?
It doesn't look like you."

393
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,142
God!

394
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:58,020
Letters-- Greenleaf
and for Ripley.

395
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,023
Ooh. Fran. "I miss you.
When are you coming home?

396
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,650
Stop telling me what
an incredible time you're having.

397
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,819
- How much you love Dickie.
- Whoo!

398
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,989
And Marge
and Mongibello."

399
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,074
And this one, I think,
is from your father.

400
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,917
- Let me see it. What does he say?
- He's getting impatient.

401
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,421
He wants me to reassure him that you're
going to be home by Thanksgiving.

402
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:27,341
You've got to get
a new jacket. Really.

403
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,593
<i>You must be sick
of wearing the same clothes.</i>

404
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:32,638
I can't. I can't keep spending
your father's money.

405
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,641
I love how
responsible you are.

406
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,852
<i>My dad should make you
chief accountant or something.</i>

407
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,897
<i>Or when I take over,
which is never, I will.</i>

408
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:45,651
Okay. When you take over,
which is never, I'll accept.

409
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,861
Let me buy you a jacket. When we
get to Rome, there's a great place--

410
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:51,573
- Battistoni.
- Battistoni.

411
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,580
<i>Roma, we're taking Tom
to Roma</i>

412
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:02,042
Were going to a-Roma

413
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,594
<i>Buongiorno.
Nice sweater.</i>

414
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,721
Where do we get
a carrozza for the Forum?

415
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:17,057
- Can we just hire any of them?
- Relax.

416
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,768
Relax!

417
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,646
Its just there's so much
to do in a single day.

418
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:26,692
The most important question is where to
eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.

419
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:28,694
Freddie?

420
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,072
Freddie.
Freddie Miles.

421
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,449
Freddie's organizing
the Cortina skiing trip.

422
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,285
Oh.

423
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,912
Oh, here he is.

424
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,543
- Frederico!
- Comestai?

425
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:53,552
Oh, God, don't you want to fuck
every woman you see just once?

426
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,805
- Only once?
- Absolutely. Once. Ciao.

427
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,807
- Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles.
- Tom.

428
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:04,021
I mean, hey, if I'm late,
think what her husband's saying.

429
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,773
- You look gorgeous.
- As always.

430
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,818
So, mangiare.

431
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,237
<i>Si. I got us a table
outside at Fabrizio's. Tommy.</i>

432
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,281
<i>Outstanding. I tell you,</i>

433
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:17,159
- I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi.
- I know. I was there.

434
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:35,802
<i>Look, Tom, we got to go to a club
and meet some friends of Freddies.</i>

435
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:39,264
The best thing is, if you want
to be a tourist, grab a cab now,

436
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:42,017
<i>and I'll meet you
at the railway station.</i>

437
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,019
What club?

438
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:49,191
Freddie's arranged it
with some of the skiing crowd.

439
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,945
Come if you want, but I thought
you wanted to go sightseeing.

440
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,989
I do, and then maybe get the jacket
and what have you.

441
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,367
Dick!
You gotta hear this.

442
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:02,454
Listen, just take
one of mine when we get back.

443
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,165
Don't worry about it.

444
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,961
Come on!

445
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,557
<i>Ciao.
Have fun, okay?</i>

446
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:37,698
You said to make sure you didn't
miss the train. Leaves at 8:00.

447
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,827
Have a good time.

448
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,620
See ya, Tommy.

449
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:00,709
What are you doing?

450
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:03,770
Oh. I was just
amusing myself.

451
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:09,706
- Sorry.
- I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

452
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,378
- Do you have my shoes on too?
- You said I could pick out a jacket--

453
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,383
Did you get undressed
in your own room?

454
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,555
Thought you missed
the train.

455
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,182
<i>Freddie drove me back
in his car.</i>

456
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:30,269
- Is Freddie here?
- He's downstairs.

457
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,522
I was just fooling around.

458
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:37,568
Don't say anything.
I was just fooling around.

459
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,238
Sorry.

460
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,617
<i>God. A corduroy jacket in Italy.</i>

461
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,619
- Good morning, Tom.
- Morning.

462
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,414
Come join us.

463
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:56,336
<i>Hey. I want this job
of yours, Tommy.</i>

464
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,339
I was just saying,
you live in Italy,

465
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:02,968
you stay at Dickie's house,
you eat Dickie's food,

466
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:07,931
<i>you wear his clothes,
and his father picks up the tab.</i>

467
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,435
<i>If you get bored,</i>

468
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:15,022
you let me know,
'cause I'll do it.

469
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,941
<i>- I'll do it.
- To the mainland!</i>

470
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:25,240
You really should go in.
It's marvelous.

471
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:28,410
I'm fine.

472
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,963
Are you okay?

473
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,133
Sure.

474
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:50,015
The thing with Dickie--

475
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:55,103
It's like the sun shines
on you, and it's glorious.

476
00:39:56,605 --> 00:40:00,150
And then he forgets you
and it's very, very cold.

477
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,152
So I'm learning.

478
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:05,739
When you have his attention, you feel
you're the only person in the world.

479
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,534
That's why
everybody loves him.

480
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:12,329
<i>It's always the same. Whenever
someone new comes into his life--</i>

481
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,957
Freddie, Fausto,
Peter Smith-Kingsley.

482
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,376
He's wonderful.
Have you met him?

483
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,339
Especially you.

484
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,638
And thats just the boys.

485
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:40,065
Come get him!
Come get him!

486
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,067
Tell me, why is it
that when men play,

487
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,695
they always play
at killing each other?

488
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,906
<i>He's drowning me!
He's drowning me!</i>

489
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,745
- I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way.
- What about Cortina?

490
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,084
Didn't--
Didn't-Didn't Dick say?

491
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,714
<i>He spoke to Freddie,
and-and apparently...</i>

492
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,716
it's not going
to work out.

493
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,928
<i>It's because
everyone else can ski,</i>

494
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:12,264
<i>and it affects
where you stay, and--</i>

495
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,191
Come on, Freddie.

496
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,860
At least stick around for
the Festival of the Madonna.

497
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,529
<i>- The whole town comes out--
- I dont think so.</i>

498
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:32,284
<i>I have my own, uh, Madonna back in Rome.
Why dont you come back with me?</i>

499
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,870
A lot of ladies.
Ooh.

500
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,711
- Oh, God.
- You want to take over?

501
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,755
Yeah, sure.

502
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,758
Just point her at Capri.
Avoid the rocks.

503
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,260
Where are you going?

504
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,346
Marge maintenance.

505
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,348
Aye-aye.

506
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,454
Don't.

507
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,095
Dickie--

508
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,976
<i>Tommy.
How's the peeping?</i>

509
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:44,273
Tommy,
how's the peeping?

510
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,402
<i>Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.</i>

511
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,391
Is someone getting
an ambulance?

512
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:50,649
Is someone getting an ambulance?

513
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:22,097
What's the fight about?
That's her fiancé, isn't it?

514
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:27,060
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?
- Are they blaming him?

515
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:30,772
How can it take an hour
to find an ambulance?

516
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,358
She was already dead, darling,
wasn't she? So I suppose--

517
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:37,946
I don't know why people say
this country is civilized.

518
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,158
- Dickie!
- It isn't. It's fucking primitive.

519
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:45,204
I'll go see
what's the matter.

520
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,206
I'll go.

521
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,766
<i>I know why youre upset.</i>

522
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,979
I know about
Silvana, Dickie.

523
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,818
I know about
you and Silvana.

524
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,403
What about us?

525
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:25,077
You don't have
to clean up! Really!

526
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,546
- Like what?
- Forget it.

527
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:40,133
She was pregnant.
Did you know that?

528
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,766
Silvana was pregnant.

529
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,645
<i>Do you know what that means
in a place like this?</i>

530
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,648
I'm prepared
to take the blame.

531
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:58,652
- What are you talking about?
- You've been so good to me.

532
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:03,448
You're the brother I never had.
I'm the brother you never had.

533
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,243
<i>I would do anything
for you, Dickie.</i>

534
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:10,622
She came to me for help.

535
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,833
She needed money.

536
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:20,299
I didn't help her.
I didn't help her.

537
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,678
<i>Now shes drowned herself,
and it's my fault.</i>

538
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,937
I'm not going
to say anything--

539
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:37,149
<i>to Marge, to the police
or anybody.</i>

540
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:40,235
It's a secret
between us, Dickie.

541
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,364
And I'll keep it.

542
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,452
<i>"Dear Tom.
in view of the fact Dickie shows...</i>

543
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:53,332
<i>no more signs of coming home than
before you went--" blah, blah, blah--</i>

544
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,168
Um--

545
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,837
"I hope that the trip has
afforded you some pleasure...

546
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,132
despite the failure
of its main objective.

547
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:06,678
You no longer should consider yourself
obligated to us in any way."

548
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,764
Can't blame him.

549
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,933
<i>You could hardly expect this
to go on forever, Tom.</i>

550
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,519
Well, you can write again.

551
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,480
- Especially now we're brothers.
- I can't.

552
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,690
How can I,
in all decency.

553
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,485
<i>You said it yourself.
Its my dad's money you're spending.</i>

554
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,697
We've had a great run
though, haven't we?

555
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,701
Well, we'll still go to Venice.
We could stick to that plan.

556
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,829
I don't think so, Tom.

557
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,498
<i>You cant pay
your own way, can you?</i>

558
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,961
<i>Its time we all moved on.</i>

559
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:43,257
I'm sick of Mongi.
Especially now, with everything--

560
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,300
I really want to move
to the north.

561
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:47,886
I need to check out
San Remo next week.

562
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,013
<i>Find somewhere new
to keep the boat.</i>

563
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:53,475
It would be great, though,
if you came with me to San Remo.

564
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,062
There's a great jazz festival.
We could say good-bye in style.

565
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,690
What do you think?

566
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,526
Our last trip!

567
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,033
Sure.

568
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,632
Why do you do
that thing with your neck?

569
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,634
What thing?

570
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:14,181
On trains, you always
do that thing.

571
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:21,104
Spooky.

572
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,025
Spook-- k-k--
k-k-- k-k--

573
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,031
Spooky.

574
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:54,012
Oh!

575
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:57,850
Didn't I tell you
San Remo was crazy?

576
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,727
This is more like it!
Come on!

577
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:13,073
<i>Grazie.</i>

578
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:16,326
To Mongibello
and the happiest days of my life.

579
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,996
To Mongi.
You're cheerful tonight.

580
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,498
I'm suddenly quite happy
to be going back.

581
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:24,334
Did I know you
at Princeton, Tom?

582
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,087
I don't think I did,
did I?

583
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,340
- Why are you asking all of a sudden?
- No reason.

584
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:33,969
Because you're leaving, I guess.
I don't think you were there.

585
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:38,223
- Why?
- I mean it as a compliment.

586
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,267
You've got
such great taste.

587
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:44,480
Most of the thugs at Princeton
had tasted everything and had no taste.

588
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:49,568
I used to say,
"the cream of America: rich and thick."

589
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,737
Freddie's
the perfect example.

590
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,406
Then I'll take it
as a compliment.

591
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,450
I knew it!
I knew it.

592
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,411
Marge and I had a bet.

593
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:09,630
Do you even like jazz,

594
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,965
or was that
for my benefit?

595
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,760
- I've gotten to like it.
- Oh, yes!

596
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:19,348
<i>Ive gotten to like everything
about the way you live.</i>

597
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,642
It's one big love affair.

598
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:25,896
If you knew my life
back home in New York--

599
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,065
I'm thinkin'
of givin' up the sax.

600
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,275
What do you think
about the drums?

601
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,570
- What?
- So cool.

602
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:36,573
I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow,
take a look around.

603
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,202
This is how I found
my place in Mongi.

604
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,288
Took a boat out...

605
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,374
around the bay,

606
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,001
first thing I liked,

607
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:50,003
I got it.

608
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,634
- Whoa!
- Come on, Dickie. Dont go crazy.

609
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:58,220
- Dickie. Slow down!
- Hold on.

610
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,264
Wait a minute!
It's gonna tip! Oh, God!

611
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:03,892
Stop it! Somebody!
Somebody! Stop it!

612
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:09,565
Oh, I love it here!

613
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:12,192
I love it here!
I'm gonna move here!

614
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,862
Beautiful.

615
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:22,369
I want to tell you
my plan.

616
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:25,330
- So tell me.
- Well, I thought...

617
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,292
I'd come back in the new year
under my own steam.

618
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,545
- Really? To Italy?
- Of course.

619
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:35,090
And I figured,
just for argument's sake,

620
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,217
say I got a place.

621
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:39,761
Or say we split
the rent on a house,

622
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:42,055
I could get a job,
or, better still,

623
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:43,974
if I got a place in Rome,
and then when we're there,

624
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,852
we could be there, and when we're here,
we could be here.

625
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:51,482
- I don't think so.
- Particularly with the Marge problem.

626
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,609
You just blame me.

627
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,323
- Marge and I are getting married.
- How?

628
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:03,327
- How?
- Yesterday, you were ogling girls.

629
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,329
Today you're getting married?
That's absurd.

630
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:11,376
- I love Marge.
- You love me. You're not marrying me.

631
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,213
- Tom, I don't love you.
- No, I don't mean that as a threat.

632
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:17,382
To be honest, I'm-Im a little
relieved you're going.

633
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,219
I think we've seen enough
of each other for a while.

634
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:27,976
- What?
- You can be a leech!

635
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:29,978
You know that!

636
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:35,150
<i>And... its boring.</i>

637
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:40,781
You can be quite boring.

638
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,003
The funny thing is,
I'm not pretending...

639
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:57,548
to be somebody else,
and you are.

640
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:00,759
<i>-Boring.
-Ive been absolutely honest with you...</i>

641
00:55:00,843 --> 00:55:02,761
about my feelings.

642
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,514
- Boring.
- But you-- First of all,

643
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:07,516
I know there's something.

644
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,561
That evening, when we played chess,
for instance, it was obvious.

645
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:14,064
- What evening?
- It's too dangerous for you to take on.

646
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,191
<i>Oh, no, no.
We're brothers.</i>

647
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:20,946
Hey. And then you do this sordid thing
with Marge-- fucking her...

648
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:22,865
<i>on the boat, while we
all have to listen,</i>

649
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,908
<i>which was
excruciating.</i>

650
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,120
And you follow your cock around like a--
And now you're getting married.

651
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,539
<i>No, Im bewildered.
Forgive me.</i>

652
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:33,041
You're lying to Marge and then
you're getting married to her.

653
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:37,421
You're knocking up Sylvana, ruining
everybody-- You want to play the sax.

654
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,923
You want to play the drums. Which is it,
Dickie? What are you actually--

655
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:45,596
Who are you? Huh?
Some third-class mooch? Who are you?

656
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,639
Who are you to say
anything to me?

657
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:50,267
Who are you
to tell me anything?

658
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,437
Actually, I really, really do
not want to be on this boat with you.

659
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,939
- I can't move without you moving.
- Shut up. Shut up.

660
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:59,443
It gives me the creeps.
You give me the creeps.

661
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,487
- You shut up.
- I can't move without "Dickie, Dickie,"

662
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,614
Like a little girl
all the time.

663
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:05,491
Shut up!

664
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:09,786
Oh, God, Dickie.

665
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,623
- God's sake.
- Oh-- Oh God!

666
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,252
Okay. Okay.

667
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,463
We have to get you-- Okay--

668
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:24,218
I'm gonna kill you!
Kill you!

669
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:29,640
You're dead!

670
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:39,316
Stop! Stop!
Please! Please!

671
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:43,445
Stop it! Stop!

672
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,449
- Dickie, let go!
- Ill kill you!

673
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:56,834
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

674
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:59,711
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

675
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:05,462
Hi. Can I have
my key, please?

676
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,506
Of course.

677
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,051
You must be very cold.
Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?

678
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,053
No. I'm--

679
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:26,293
Hello, Marge.

680
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:29,004
Tom!

681
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:31,131
You startled me!

682
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:34,384
- Sorry. How are you?
- You're back!

683
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,929
- Your book going well?
- Yes.

684
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:40,015
I'm on a good streak,
thank you.

685
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:43,685
I was just...
Looking at you. So quiet.

686
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:46,730
Where's Dickie?

687
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:53,028
I think he's planning on staying
in Rome for a few days.

688
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:56,865
Rome? Ahh.
Did he say why?

689
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,952
I don't understand Dickie.
Your guess is as good as mine.

690
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:01,995
What does that mean?

691
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,583
Oh, one day I'm invited skiing,
the next day I'm not.

692
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:13,048
<i>One day, we're one family,
then the next day he wants to be alone.</i>

693
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,050
<i>You tell me.</i>

694
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,678
Is that what he said?
He wants to be alone?

695
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:22,182
He was thinking of you.
He asked me to deliver this.

696
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:25,602
Thank you.

697
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,729
<i>He knows
I love this.</i>

698
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:32,568
- But why it couldn't have waited. I--
- Errand number one.:

699
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,195
deliver Marge's perfume.

700
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:37,823
Errand number two:

701
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:41,076
pack some clothes
and his precious saxophone.

702
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:44,705
How long is he staying for?

703
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:48,208
Search me.
I guess we're abandoned.

704
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:16,945
Goddamn it!

705
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:20,240
Are you okay?

706
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:34,129
<i>There was a letter from Dickie
in with my perfume.</i>

707
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:39,885
You realize it's more
than just a few days.

708
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:43,972
He's thinking of moving to Rome.

709
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,433
<i>The thing is,</i>

710
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:49,186
the night before
he left, we--

711
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,355
we talked about
moving together...

712
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:55,150
<i>somewhere north,
and I suppose I...</i>

713
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:01,031
put some pressure on him
about getting married.

714
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,202
I just--

715
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:09,498
I just might have
scared him off.

716
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,840
There's a side to him...

717
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:21,218
when our heads
are on the pillow...

718
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,680
I know no one else sees
that's so tender.

719
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:30,018
I think I should come with you
to Rome and confront him.

720
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,236
He hates
being confronted.

721
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:43,240
I think youre right.

722
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,334
<i>Grazie.
Checking in.</i>

723
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,720
Checking in.

724
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:08,891
- Signor Ripley?
- It's me.

725
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:14,188
Signor Greenleaf.

726
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:16,732
Of course.
Welcome back.

727
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:19,193
Thank you.

728
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,587
Pronto?

729
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,049
Yes, I'd like to telephone
the Hotel Goldoni.

730
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:46,720
- Si, signor.
- I want to speak to Thomas Ripley.

731
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:49,723
- Ripley? Subito.
- Yes. Grazie.

732
01:05:01,845 --> 01:05:02,750
<i>Pronto.</i>

733
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:04,696
Signor Greenleaf,
Signor Ripley's not there.

734
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,907
- He's not there?
- No, signor.

735
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:09,701
Well, I would like
to leave a message.

736
01:05:09,785 --> 01:05:12,037
- He's not there? I'll leave a message.
- No, signor.

737
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,248
- Got your call.
- Got your call.

738
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:16,250
- Dinner tonight...
- Dinner tonight...

739
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,252
- sounds fine.
- sounds fine.

740
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:21,797
- Ripley. Ripley.
- Ripley.

741
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,384
- Dickie Greenleaf.
- Dickie Greenleaf.

742
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:28,428
- Yes. Greenleaf.
- Greenleaf.

743
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,639
At the Grand.

744
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:34,143
<i>And Id like to have
this wallet embossed.</i>

745
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:36,145
I don't know
the word in Italian.

746
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:38,230
Embossed. Of course,
Signor Greenleaf.

747
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:40,315
Thank you.

748
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:47,739
Dickie!
It's--

749
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:52,744
- Oh, my gosh.
- Meredith.

750
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:54,746
- Ciao!
- Ciao. Come in. Come in.

751
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,457
But you're going skiing
with those Yankees, aren't you?

752
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:02,212
- What?
- At Christmas. To Cortina.

753
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,256
- With Freddie Miles.
- How did you know that?

754
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:08,343
Oh! Everybody
knows Freddie Miles.

755
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,056
Is Freddie in Rome?

756
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,058
- Now?
- Yeah.

757
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:17,478
Oh, I don't think so.

758
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:21,982
But I-- But I've met him,
of course, and we've chatted.

759
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:25,652
And I know about you...

760
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:28,322
and Marge in Mongi.

761
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:31,617
What an unreliable
rat you are.

762
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,952
Well, Freddie said
you were a rat.

763
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:36,330
And I thought
to myself,

764
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:39,500
"Ah, now I know why
he travels under 'R."'

765
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,919
I've left Marge,
Meredith.

766
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,213
And Mongi.

767
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:47,549
- So the rat's here in Rome.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

768
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:50,761
Oh, don't be sorry, no.
I've never been happier.

769
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:54,139
I-- I feel like
I've been handed a new life.

770
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:58,101
The truth is that if youve had money
your entire life,

771
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:01,480
either you despise it,
which we do-- agreed?

772
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:04,525
You're only truly comfortable
around other people...

773
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:07,653
who have it
and despise it.

774
01:07:07,736 --> 01:07:09,655
I know.

775
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:13,784
I've never admitted that
to anyone.

776
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:22,584
<i>Because my friend
Mr. Greenleaf, Signor Greenleaf and I,</i>

777
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:24,586
<i>are on a little spending spree.</i>

778
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:28,632
- I see.
- We're behaving very badly.

779
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:33,178
<i>Oh, I love Italian money. So dark.
Doesn't make you feel guilty.</i>

780
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,180
- Gr-r-razie.
- Thank you.

781
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:49,278
I don't want too many large bills.
No one will change them.

782
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:51,446
<i>Tutto bene,
Signor Greenleaf.</i>

783
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:10,924
- I really like this too.
- I think I'm having that too.

784
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:19,766
Tomorrow.

785
01:08:24,605 --> 01:08:27,065
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci. Oops!

786
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,235
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

787
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:40,162
I know you're a jazz fiend,
but do you absolutely hate the opera?

788
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:46,293
I've--
I've...

789
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:49,963
been trying to give
my tickets away.

790
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:54,510
It's tomorrow. But if
you were prepared to be dragged--

791
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,180
You could drag me.

792
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:50,167
Feodor Chaliapin.
It's the whole Russian baritone.

793
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,629
Thank you so much
for inviting me tonight.

794
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:57,549
Can you bear it?
We hear you are a friend of Freddie's.

795
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:00,802
He has "I hate opera"
tattooed on his chest.

796
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:03,388
There's room for a whole
libretto on Freddie's chest.

797
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:07,810
I'm sure
we've met before.

798
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:10,813
I was sure we'd met before.
Weren't you, Ted?

799
01:11:10,896 --> 01:11:12,940
Dick is Herbert
Greenleaf's boy.

800
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:15,567
- I know.
- Yes, I think we have.

801
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:19,738
One minute you people are children,
and the next you're getting tattooed.

802
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,284
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

803
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,330
Cheers.

804
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:35,045
- Excuse me.
- Prego.

805
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:37,464
Oh!
Excuse me.

806
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

807
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,220
- Tom!
- Marge!

808
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,431
How are you?
What are you doing in Rome?

809
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:50,144
- Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
- No. Um, no.

810
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:53,313
Um, hello.
Um, I'm Tom Ripley.

811
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,774
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard
all about you from Marge and Dickie.

812
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:58,819
- Ditto.
- No-No glasses.

813
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,697
So, where are you hiding him?
He's impossible, isn't he?

814
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,907
Is he really not here?

815
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:07,661
Marge, you know Dickie has
"I hate opera" tattooed on his chest.

816
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:10,747
- I thought you were going to Venice.
- Yes, what happened with that?

817
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:12,749
I heard you were
desperate to come.

818
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,835
I was rather looking forward
to rowing you around.

819
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:18,589
I am. I really am.

820
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:21,884
I've been traveling, and I just can't
seem to get that far north.

821
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,844
Well, you should hurry,
before we sink.

822
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:27,014
<i>Look, let me give you
the telephone number.</i>

823
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:29,933
There. Oh, look.
There's Meredith.

824
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:33,270
<i>Meredith. What's her name,
Marge? The textile people.</i>

825
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:36,815
Um, come on. Some of us
spent Christmas at her house.

826
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,652
I don't know her.

827
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:44,531
He hasn't called.
He's hardly written.

828
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:46,700
Just these cryptic
notes, you know?

829
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:48,827
You dont just dump people.

830
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:52,539
<i>Look, will we see you later,
or are you with people?</i>

831
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:55,584
- Uh, I can't later.
- Well, how about tomorrow?

832
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,586
<i>Yes, uh,
maybe in the morning?</i>

833
01:12:57,669 --> 01:13:01,340
Do you know Cafe Dinelli
at the Piazza di Spagna?

834
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:04,885
- I know the Piazza. What time?
- 10:30?

835
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,221
- We'll be there.
- Okay.

836
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:09,306
So I'll see you
in the morning, Marge?

837
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:12,434
<i>30?
Very nice to meet you.</i>

838
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,561
<i>And you.</i>

839
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:19,316
Come on.

840
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:23,320
Come on.
Let's go back in.

841
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:32,329
I don't understand why
Tom's still in Rome.

842
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:36,667
- Let's go.
- I thought you were enjoying yourself.

843
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,044
Let's take a carrozza
and look at the moon.

844
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,046
Are you crazy?
It's freezing out there.

845
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:43,924
Come on. I need to talk to you.
Just the two of us.

846
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,093
<i>Okay.</i>

847
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,391
Don't worry, please.

848
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:55,310
Don't worry.

849
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:59,481
You're such a pal
to understand. I--

850
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:01,692
It's like Marge is here
right now. I look at you,

851
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,861
<i>and I see her face.</i>

852
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:06,697
And I can't-- No matter
what I'm feeling towards you--

853
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:12,161
No. I absolutely...
understand. Of c--

854
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:15,706
Otherwise, you'd be
fighting me off.

855
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:17,749
Beating you away.

856
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:59,666
But will you meet me
tomorrow?

857
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:02,961
Just to say good-bye properly,
you know, in the daylight,

858
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:05,172
so it's not just this.

859
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:08,008
Of course. Meredith, I'm sorry.
Of course I'll meet you.

860
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:13,347
You should always
save pain for daylight.

861
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:16,683
Why don't we have coffee
in the morning at Dinelli's?

862
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,936
Uh, by the Spanish Steps.

863
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,854
Exactly. 10:30?

864
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,193
- 10:15.
- Okay.

865
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,403
Okay.

866
01:16:19,621 --> 01:16:21,957
- Grazie.
- Peter?

867
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,544
<i>Hello.
It's Meredith Logue.</i>

868
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:28,297
<i>Of course it is.
Meredith, hello. Sorry.</i>

869
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,425
- I was half asleep. How are you?
- How are you?

870
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,886
This is Marge Sherwood.
Meredith Logue.

871
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:36,972
How do you do?

872
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:40,392
<i>Do join us, wont you?
Were just waiting for a friend.</i>

873
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:43,187
I-- I won't, actually.
I think there's--

874
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,856
- Did we see you at the opera last night?
- Uh--

875
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:48,650
Are you waiting for Dickie?

876
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:52,863
Dickie? Do you-- Do you--
Do you know Dickie?

877
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:56,074
You were at the opera.
Oh, that explains-- Yes, I was there.

878
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,703
I was there with Dickie.

879
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:03,540
I knew it.

880
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:05,834
<i>I told you.</i>

881
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,424
Marge, I don't know you,
so I've got no right to--

882
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:15,719
Dickie loves you.
He's-- Well--

883
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:18,931
I think youll find
he's on his way home to you.

884
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:23,060
Well, how-how-how
would you know that?

885
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:26,855
He... told me everything.

886
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:31,860
No, I was supposed to meet him
15 minutes ago, so, uh,

887
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:34,363
I'm gonna go now,
I think.

888
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:38,742
God, unless he meant us
to meet.

889
01:17:38,826 --> 01:17:40,994
<i>Thatd be a little cruel,
wouldn't it?</i>

890
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:43,497
<i>No, no, we're
meeting another friend.</i>

891
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:46,375
- Tom Ripley.
- Do you know Tom Ripley?

892
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:51,296
No, no. I've heard about him,
of course, but I didn't meet him, no.

893
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,841
Not for me. No, grazie.

894
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:02,099
Hope I didn't
complicate matters.

895
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:07,521
God, nothing, nothing...
untoward happened.

896
01:18:07,563 --> 01:18:11,817
<i>No, there is nothing to prevent you
from welcoming him back,</i>

897
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,819
from marrying him.

898
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:21,076
Good-bye.
I'm happy to put a face to a name.

899
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,662
Good-bye, Peter.
Please, don't get up.

900
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:47,311
Now I don't know what to
think. Do you think he's coming back?

901
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:52,316
Sorry. Sorry.
Had to renew my papers.

902
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,735
Never one stamp when they
can make you line up for three.

903
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:56,904
- Have you been waiting long?
- Not at all.

904
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:59,698
- Morning, Tom.
- Hi. Sorry.

905
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:01,742
<i>You okay? You look like
youve seen a ghost.</i>

906
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:04,495
Dickie was at the opera
last night.

907
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:07,915
I don't believe that. Uh--
Wild horses couldn't drag Dickie--

908
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:10,250
Well, he was there
with someone, you know,

909
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,836
so I suppose she must
have dragged him.

910
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,756
It's not fair.

911
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:19,968
I think I'm going back to Mongi.
I think Dickie's coming home.

912
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:22,679
Really? I-- Well,
thats just swell.

913
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:25,390
No, you know, you're
way ahead of me. Great.

914
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,434
That was rather moving
when I heard-- I'm sorry.

915
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:29,937
Meredith is the American girl
I saw at the opera last night.

916
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:34,066
- Shes been seeing something of Dickie.
- Oh, my God.

917
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:37,611
<i>But the point is,
Dickie-- and we all know this.</i>

918
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:41,365
Dickie loves Marge.
And he misses her.

919
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,201
I feel guilty.
Marge doesn't understand this,

920
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:47,120
but whenever Dickie does
something, I feel guilty.

921
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:49,498
As if that makes sense.

922
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:14,875
<i>Dickie.</i>

923
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:18,921
Dickie, come on. It's me.

924
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,300
It's Freddie.
Let me in.

925
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:28,263
<i>Dickie.</i>

926
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,355
Hello, Freddie.
It's Tom.

927
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,400
<i>Um, where's Dickie?</i>

928
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:42,402
How are you?

929
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:45,531
I'm good. Uh, yes, thank you.
He's gone. He went to dinner.

930
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:49,952
- He's at Otello's. You know Otello's?
- No, no, no.

931
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:52,830
I-I don't think he's
at dinner at 6:30 P.M.

932
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:56,208
If you said he was still at lunch,
maybe I'd believe you.

933
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:59,878
You know?
Incredible.

934
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,882
I mean, the guy just, you know,
disappeared off the face of the earth.

935
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:07,970
I guess.

936
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:12,182
The landlady,
as far as I could tell--

937
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:16,061
<i>The landlady said
he was here right now.</i>

938
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:18,355
Search the place.

939
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:21,817
I-I just don't-- I don't know why you'd
imagine that Dickie would hide from you.

940
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,819
Because he's been
hiding from me.

941
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:29,825
- What happened at Christmas?
- What about Christmas?

942
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:33,036
<i>He was supposed to come skiing.
I didn't get a cable...</i>

943
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,330
or a call or a little note
or a--

944
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:39,918
Frankly, a fart.

945
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:42,254
Well, he's been very involved
with his music.

946
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:46,550
Um, I think his theory... is...

947
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:51,221
that you have to go into a cocoon,
uh, before you can be a butterfly.

948
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:53,849
Which is horseshit.

949
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:57,394
You hear him play this thing?
Well, he can't.

950
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:02,357
How did you find him?

951
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:05,444
<i>It's such an out-of-the-way apartment.
Can I fix you a drink?</i>

952
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:08,489
No, thanks.
At the American Express.

953
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:14,328
Some kid.

954
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:22,794
Are you living here?

955
01:23:22,836 --> 01:23:25,964
No, no. I'm staying here
for a few days.

956
01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:31,303
But--

957
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:35,057
It's a new piano.
Probably shouldn't--

958
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:42,189
Probably shouldn't--

959
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:48,904
Did this place come furnished?

960
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:52,157
<i>It doesn't
look like Dickie's, uh--</i>

961
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:55,327
It's really horrible,
isn't it?

962
01:23:56,912 --> 01:24:00,415
<i>It's so, uh, bourgeois.</i>

963
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:12,136
Oh, that's a, uh--
You should-- Watch that.

964
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:15,347
Excuse--
Excuse me.

965
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:17,349
Excuse me.

966
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:25,023
In fact, the only thing that looks
like Dickie... is you.

967
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:27,109
- Hardly.
- Hmm.

968
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:31,780
Have you done something
to your hair?

969
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:33,866
Is there something
you'd like to say, Freddie?

970
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:36,368
- What?
- You have something you'd like to say?

971
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,787
I think I'm saying it.

972
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:43,375
<i>Somethings going on.</i>

973
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:46,295
Either he's converted
to Christianity,

974
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:49,423
or there's something else.

975
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:53,010
Well, I would suggest you
ask Dickie that yourself.

976
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:55,971
Otello's is on della Croce
just off the Corso.

977
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:59,516
<i>Is it on della Croce
just off the Corso?</i>

978
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:05,856
<i>Sure. You're
a quick study, arent you?</i>

979
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:07,858
Last time you didn't know
you ass from your elbow.

980
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:10,360
Now you're giving me directions.

981
01:25:10,444 --> 01:25:14,198
<i>Thats not fair. You probably
do know your ass from your elbow.</i>

982
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:19,036
I'll see you.

983
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:33,759
<i>No Dickie Greenleaf. Thomas Ripley.</i>

984
01:25:33,842 --> 01:25:37,262
<i>Si.</i>

985
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:44,436
<i>Ciao, Dickie.</i>

986
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:51,401
Dickie doesn't
play the piano.

987
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:54,863
<i>Tommy.</i>

988
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:56,865
<i>Tommy!</i>

989
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:58,867
<i>Tommy!</i>

990
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:40,200
Oh!
You're making me laugh.

991
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:44,079
No. Youre just so drunk.
Oh. Youre just--

992
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:47,499
What can you do, eh?
You should see my other friends.

993
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:49,960
What canyon do?

994
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:53,255
Yes.
Such a pig.

995
01:26:56,758 --> 01:27:02,014
Hey, if I'm drunk,
think what her husband's saying.

996
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:51,814
- La polizia.
- Dickie Greenleaf?

997
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:54,900
- Yes.
- Inspector Roverini.

998
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:56,985
- Can we come in?
- Please.

999
01:28:04,743 --> 01:28:07,037
It's a terrible shock,
huh?

1000
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,833
W-What time did Signor Miles
leave yesterday?

1001
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:14,920
Oh, um, I can't be certain
exactly. I--

1002
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:16,922
8:00, 9:00.

1003
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,221
We'd both taken on, uh,
far too many drinks.

1004
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:28,851
But it was dark. It was certainly dark
when I-- when I walked him to his car.

1005
01:28:28,934 --> 01:28:31,895
So he drove away,
and, uh, you did what?

1006
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:35,023
I went to bed.

1007
01:28:35,107 --> 01:28:39,778
Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble
after a couple of drinks.

1008
01:28:39,862 --> 01:28:43,240
I've been suffering all--

1009
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:45,367
Who found him?

1010
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:48,036
You understand, I must ask you...

1011
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,664
to stay in Rome,
Signor Greenleaf.

1012
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:54,084
Yes, if it's gonna help,
certainly.

1013
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:57,921
<i>So, the doctor, he has to make
the, um--</i>

1014
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:04,636
- Postmortem.
- Yeah, exactly.

1015
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,389
But, you know,
his first conclusion...

1016
01:29:07,473 --> 01:29:12,519
was that Signor Miles was killed
not later than 7:00 yesterday evening.

1017
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:15,981
Well, he certainly wasn't dead
when he drove away in his car.

1018
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:20,027
No.

1019
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:47,846
It's okay.

1020
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:50,307
- Okay?
- Si, si.

1021
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:04,321
- Did he kill Freddie?
- Marge. When did you get here?

1022
01:30:04,363 --> 01:30:06,990
Tell me the truth.
Did he kill Freddie?

1023
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:10,619
I'd swear he didn't.
Of course he didn't.

1024
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:14,915
I tried again.
Waiting here, watching for him.

1025
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:18,585
Instead, it's you.
Whenever I look for Dickie, I find you.

1026
01:30:20,504 --> 01:30:23,465
What happened to your face?

1027
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:25,509
Dickie--
Dickie did it.

1028
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,803
- Dickie?
- My face. There was an argument.

1029
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:30,556
I-- I said some things
I shouldn't have said and I--

1030
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:34,268
About you. About the appalling way
he's treating you, all of us.

1031
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:36,645
<i>And the next thing I know,
he's launched himself at me.</i>

1032
01:30:36,728 --> 01:30:38,856
- Are you getting on?
- What?

1033
01:30:38,897 --> 01:30:41,066
Get on.
I'll take you to him.

1034
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:27,779
- Where does he live?
- We passed it a few blocks back.

1035
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:30,282
It's where the police were.
The Palazzo Gioia.

1036
01:31:32,284 --> 01:31:35,287
Look, they don't even know I'm in Rome,
and I'm not gonna incriminate Dickie.

1037
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:37,372
Well, perhaps
I shouldn't go either.

1038
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:41,084
No. Well, go if you want to, but just
don't talk to the police about my face.

1039
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:44,505
If they know he hit me and his temper,
then he could've hit Freddie.

1040
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:46,548
I'll catch up
with you later.

1041
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:07,736
Signor Greenleaf!

1042
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:10,405
<i>It's Signor Greenleaf!
Presto, presto!</i>

1043
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:18,080
Open the door!

1044
01:32:18,163 --> 01:32:20,541
Open up!

1045
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:22,876
I live here!

1046
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:26,004
Mr. Greenleaf!

1047
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:29,550
Can we go up?
Do you mind?

1048
01:32:29,633 --> 01:32:32,219
Of course.
What happened to your face?

1049
01:32:32,302 --> 01:32:35,973
My scooter. I fell off
getting chased by photographers.

1050
01:32:36,056 --> 01:32:40,102
The telephone, the press,
I've been-- I'm feeling hounded.

1051
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:42,312
Do you think you could
not give out my address?

1052
01:32:42,354 --> 01:32:46,984
Never. We've had many requests,
and we say no, even to your fiancée.

1053
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,027
I really don't want
to see anybody.

1054
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:51,864
- Even your fiancée?
- Even her.

1055
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:58,162
- What about Thomas Ripley?
- What about Tom Ripley?

1056
01:33:00,164 --> 01:33:02,166
You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo.
Is that right?

1057
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:05,335
Yes, we-- We went to San Remo.
That was months ago.

1058
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,588
November, I thought.
Was it?

1059
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:11,216
- Did you speak to Tom?
- November 7 is my information.

1060
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:14,052
<i>I dont remember
the exact date.</i>

1061
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:18,557
- When did you last see Signor Ripley?
- A few days ago.

1062
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:22,186
- Does he stay with you here?
- No.

1063
01:33:22,269 --> 01:33:24,646
<i>No.</i>

1064
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,984
Here is a pattern.
Two days ago,

1065
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:32,029
Freddie Miles is dead,
hmm?

1066
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,741
<i>He leaves your apartment,</i>

1067
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:39,578
and he's murdered.

1068
01:33:39,661 --> 01:33:44,791
Yesterday, a little boat
is found in San Remo full of rocks.

1069
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:49,755
<i>And the owner tells the police
it was stolen on November 7.</i>

1070
01:33:49,797 --> 01:33:52,299
<i>We look at hotel records...</i>

1071
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:55,177
and we see...

1072
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:58,430
Dickie Greenleaf
is staying in San Remo.

1073
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:02,267
And then our boatman remembers
two Americans taking a boat.

1074
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:05,145
That is not a pattern.
That's a coincidence.

1075
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:07,189
There must be 50 hotels
in San Remo.

1076
01:34:07,272 --> 01:34:10,108
There were probably a hundred people
renting a boat that day.

1077
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:12,653
Thirty-one people.

1078
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,738
Thirty-one people.

1079
01:34:15,864 --> 01:34:17,783
Thirty-one, yeah.

1080
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:22,621
- Marge Sherwood.
- That is Miss Sherwood now.

1081
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,423
Let her in.

1082
01:34:33,465 --> 01:34:36,135
Let her in.
What's the difference? Let her in.

1083
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:42,015
No! Actually--
Actually, no.

1084
01:34:42,099 --> 01:34:44,977
I would-- I would
really appreciate it...

1085
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,938
<i>if you would ask Miss Sherwood
to come back later.</i>

1086
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:55,320
Thank you.

1087
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:58,991
May I ask you--

1088
01:34:59,074 --> 01:35:02,619
Why would you speak to your friend
and not your fiancée?

1089
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:06,039
Well, I--
I think I just said.

1090
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:09,459
<i>Um, Mr. Ripley was
handling some business for me.</i>

1091
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:12,129
<i>Nor does Mr. Ripley
want to marry me...</i>

1092
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:16,258
and ask me every single day
if I'll marry him and when.

1093
01:35:17,426 --> 01:35:19,428
Do you keep a photograph
of Signor Ripley?

1094
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:23,348
I'm not in the habit of carrying
around photographs of my male friends.

1095
01:35:25,017 --> 01:35:26,935
Now I think I've upset you.

1096
01:35:27,019 --> 01:35:30,147
Sorry. My English,
perhaps, is coarse.

1097
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:32,691
It is a little coarse,
yes.

1098
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:38,113
I'm sorry.

1099
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:43,160
<i>But you-- No one has seen
Signor Ripley since San Remo.</i>

1100
01:35:43,243 --> 01:35:45,204
- I have.
- You have, yes.

1101
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:47,998
And so has Miss Sherwood.
Ask her. And, um,

1102
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:53,170
if I can remember the name
of the hotel he was staying at--

1103
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:56,298
Um, the Goldoni.
Tom was staying at the Goldoni.

1104
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:59,760
Goldoni. The Goldoni.
Good, good, but--

1105
01:35:59,843 --> 01:36:02,387
Yes, you are right.

1106
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:04,723
You are right.
A coincidence.

1107
01:36:06,809 --> 01:36:10,395
I look forward
to our next meeting.

1108
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:12,481
Hmm? When I will be
more careful with my English.

1109
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:16,819
<i>Ah. I have a witness
who thinks they saw two men...</i>

1110
01:36:16,902 --> 01:36:18,821
<i>getting into Mr. Miles' car.</i>

1111
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:22,783
<i>And she wants to identify you
in a confronto.</i>

1112
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:25,369
Lineup. Tomorrow, then?

1113
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:28,789
Uh, tomorrow.

1114
01:36:36,421 --> 01:36:38,340
- Buon giorno, Miss Sherwood.
- Buon giorno.

1115
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:42,553
<i>He's in, but I really don't think
he wants to meet anybody.</i>

1116
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:01,905
Dick?

1117
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:07,536
Dickie?

1118
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:10,998
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

1119
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,135
I was gonna say that I would count to
three, and if you didn't open the door--

1120
01:37:23,218 --> 01:37:27,473
But I won't count anymore.

1121
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:29,558
On you.

1122
01:37:31,602 --> 01:37:35,105
I won't count on you
anymore.

1123
01:37:38,567 --> 01:37:43,489
Whatever it is you've done
or haven't done,

1124
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:46,033
you've broken my heart.

1125
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:50,704
<i>That's one thing
I know you're guilty of.</i>

1126
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:00,714
And I don't know why.

1127
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:06,637
I don't know why.
I just don't know why.

1128
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,690
<i>My dear Tom.</i>

1129
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:22,319
<i>Im getting out of this.</i>

1130
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:25,906
<i>Freddie's death. Silvana.</i>

1131
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:30,202
<i>Ive thought about going to the police,
but I cant do it.</i>

1132
01:38:30,244 --> 01:38:32,621
<i>I cant face it.</i>

1133
01:38:32,704 --> 01:38:34,081
<i>I cant face anything anymore.</i>

1134
01:38:34,122 --> 01:38:35,457
<i>I cant face anything anymore.</i>

1135
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:38,293
<i>I wish I could give you
the life I took for granted.</i>

1136
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,924
<i>You've always understood
whats at the heart of me, Tom.</i>

1137
01:38:44,007 --> 01:38:47,386
<i>Marge never could.</i>

1138
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:50,848
<i>I suppose that's why
Im writing this to you,</i>

1139
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:53,517
<i>the brother I never had.</i>

1140
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,353
<i>The only true friend
I ever had.</i>

1141
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:03,944
<i>in all kinds of ways,</i>

1142
01:39:04,027 --> 01:39:08,323
<i>you're much more like the son
my father wanted.</i>

1143
01:39:08,407 --> 01:39:11,618
<i>I realize you can
change the people,</i>

1144
01:39:11,702 --> 01:39:14,204
<i>change the scenery,</i>

1145
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:16,456
<i>but you can't change
your own rotten self.</i>

1146
01:39:19,251 --> 01:39:22,004
<i>Now I can't think what to do
or where to go.</i>

1147
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:28,677
<i>Im haunted by everything
Ive done and cant undo.</i>

1148
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:32,222
<i>Im sorry.</i>

1149
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:37,686
<i>Ive made a mess of being
Dickie Greenleaf, haven't I?</i>

1150
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:45,045
<i>Tom!</i>

1151
01:40:47,214 --> 01:40:50,509
I'll see you over there!

1152
01:40:58,892 --> 01:41:01,186
I'm so sorry to put you
through this, Peter.

1153
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:04,857
I just can't face going to the police
by myself when my Italian's so rotten.

1154
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,942
Don't be so daft.
It's fine.

1155
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:09,653
I'm delighted you finally
made it to Venice.

1156
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:12,364
I'm delighted, contrary to rumor,
that you're still in one piece.

1157
01:41:12,447 --> 01:41:14,449
- What rumor?
- Oh, you know.

1158
01:41:14,533 --> 01:41:17,953
That Dickie murdered you
and is traveling under your passport.

1159
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:20,122
I know. It's ridiculous.

1160
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:36,889
Welcome to Venice.

1161
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:40,017
God, this place reeks, doesn't it?
Can you smell it?

1162
01:41:40,058 --> 01:41:43,937
Anyway, I've got to
the bottom of the delay, finally.

1163
01:41:44,021 --> 01:41:46,940
We're waiting
for someone from Rome.

1164
01:41:47,024 --> 01:41:49,359
What do you mean?
They've sent for someone from Rome?

1165
01:41:49,401 --> 01:41:52,529
- Well, yes. That's good, isn't it?
- No, I thought...

1166
01:41:52,613 --> 01:41:55,991
that didn't happen in Italy,
that each region is separate.

1167
01:41:56,074 --> 01:41:58,494
I was sure that--
I've read that--

1168
01:41:58,577 --> 01:42:01,413
You've read the papers.
You know what a big deal it's been.

1169
01:42:01,497 --> 01:42:04,541
- American tourist murdered.
- Actually, can we not do this now?

1170
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:08,712
The stench really is--

1171
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:30,609
He's taken over the case, 'cause they're
annoyed that the previous chap...

1172
01:42:30,692 --> 01:42:33,570
<i>let Dickie disappear
when he was, um,</i>

1173
01:42:33,612 --> 01:42:35,614
<i>the only suspect
in Freddies murder.</i>

1174
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:41,954
In Rome,
about three weeks ago.

1175
01:42:41,995 --> 01:42:43,956
I knew that one.

1176
01:42:43,997 --> 01:42:48,085
Um--

1177
01:42:51,171 --> 01:42:56,009
Are you a homosexual?
Interesting non sequitur.

1178
01:42:56,093 --> 01:42:58,095
No.

1179
01:42:58,178 --> 01:43:01,431
- No.
- Oh.

1180
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:06,395
By the way, um, officially
there are no Italian homosexuals.

1181
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:08,981
Makes Michelangelo and
Leonardo very inconvenient.

1182
01:43:09,064 --> 01:43:10,774
Eh?

1183
01:43:10,816 --> 01:43:14,027
Tell him...
I have a fiancée.

1184
01:43:14,111 --> 01:43:16,488
And Dickie has a fiancée.

1185
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:20,159
And that Freddie Miles
probably had a string of them.

1186
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:35,716
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

1187
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:41,513
- What did he say?
- He says "so many fiancées."

1188
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:49,688
<i>Hes asking... if you
killed Freddie Miles...</i>

1189
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,690
<i>and then killed Dickie Greenleaf.</i>

1190
01:43:51,732 --> 01:43:55,694
No! No, I did not kill Freddie Miles
and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.

1191
01:43:55,777 --> 01:43:58,989
<i>Is he accusing me?
Ask him if he's accusingme.</i>

1192
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:01,825
The way it works here,
it's better to be less volatile.

1193
01:44:01,867 --> 01:44:04,036
But its absurd!

1194
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:24,014
They found this
in Dickie's place in Rome.

1195
01:44:24,097 --> 01:44:26,683
- You opened this?
- Of course.

1196
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:45,828
It's a suicide note.

1197
01:44:49,623 --> 01:44:53,502
You asked me all these questions and you
already read this suicide note?

1198
01:45:11,854 --> 01:45:13,939
I don't believe that letter.
Do you?

1199
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:17,568
Dickie's letter.
Do you believe it?

1200
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:20,070
I don't know
what to believe.

1201
01:45:20,112 --> 01:45:24,825
Can you imagine, though, if he did
kill Freddie, what that must be like?

1202
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,787
Just to wake up every morning.
I mean, how can you?

1203
01:45:28,871 --> 01:45:32,332
Just wake up and be a person?
Drink your coffee.

1204
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:36,837
Well, whatever you do,
however terrible, however hurtful,

1205
01:45:36,879 --> 01:45:40,215
it all makes sense,
doesn't it, in your head.

1206
01:45:40,257 --> 01:45:43,051
You never meet anybody
who thinks they're a bad person.

1207
01:45:43,093 --> 01:45:47,139
No, I know, but you're still tormented.
You must be. You've killed someone.

1208
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:50,350
Don't you just take the past
and put it in a room in the basement,

1209
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:52,394
and lock the door
and never go in there?

1210
01:45:52,478 --> 01:45:55,856
- That's what I do.
- God, yes.

1211
01:45:55,898 --> 01:46:00,569
But, of course, in my case,
it's probably a whole building.

1212
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:03,655
And then you meet someone special,

1213
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:07,784
and all you want to do
is toss them the key.

1214
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:11,705
Say "Open up. Step inside."

1215
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:16,627
But you can't...

1216
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:19,463
because it's dark...

1217
01:46:19,546 --> 01:46:22,424
and there are demons.

1218
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:25,928
And if anybody saw
how ugly it is--

1219
01:46:30,641 --> 01:46:32,684
Now that's the music talking.

1220
01:46:34,937 --> 01:46:38,273
It's harder to be bleak if youre
playing "Knees Up, Mother Brown."

1221
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:46,949
I keep wanting to do that.

1222
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:50,911
Fling...
the door open.

1223
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:57,042
Just let the light in,
clean everything out.

1224
01:46:59,336 --> 01:47:03,340
If I could take a giant eraser
and rub out everything,

1225
01:47:03,423 --> 01:47:06,343
starting with myself--

1226
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:12,141
<i>The thing is, Peter, if--</i>

1227
01:47:14,685 --> 01:47:18,313
- Hmm?
- If--

1228
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:22,109
If--

1229
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:31,493
No key, huh?

1230
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:17,915
- Marge.
- Peter.

1231
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:22,336
- So good to see you.
- Hello, Marge.

1232
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:24,588
Tom.

1233
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:28,717
- I see you found Peter.
- I think we sort of found each other.

1234
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:32,513
- Where's Dickie's father?
- He's not coming till the morning.

1235
01:48:32,596 --> 01:48:36,141
Evidently his stomach. I don't think
the food here is agreeing with him.

1236
01:48:36,225 --> 01:48:38,143
Oh, I was looking forward
to seeing him.

1237
01:48:38,227 --> 01:48:40,938
Dickie hasn't killed himself.
I'm sure of that.

1238
01:48:41,021 --> 01:48:43,565
There's a private detective
on the case now.

1239
01:48:43,649 --> 01:48:46,151
A Mr. MacCarron
Dickie's father's employed.

1240
01:48:46,235 --> 01:48:49,571
- That's a terrific idea.
- He's American.

1241
01:48:49,655 --> 01:48:52,991
He's already discovered
that Dickie cashed checks for $1,000...

1242
01:48:53,075 --> 01:48:55,244
the day before
he disappeared.

1243
01:48:55,327 --> 01:48:57,246
Signora.

1244
01:48:57,329 --> 01:49:00,749
Is that what you do
before you jump into the Tiber?

1245
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:03,418
<i>I dont think so.</i>

1246
01:49:07,256 --> 01:49:09,466
- Is this you?
- No, it's Tom's.

1247
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:11,468
Splendid, eh?

1248
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:14,888
Golly.
Who's paying for this?

1249
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:16,932
Peter found it for me.

1250
01:49:16,974 --> 01:49:21,895
I can afford it because
it's damp and... falling down.

1251
01:49:21,937 --> 01:49:25,107
- Tom's transformed it.
- This is spectacular.

1252
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:27,442
That's why
Tom wanted you to stay.

1253
01:49:27,526 --> 01:49:30,112
<i>It's better than trying
to squeeze into my room.</i>

1254
01:49:30,195 --> 01:49:32,281
<i>And I know
how you hate hotels.</i>

1255
01:49:32,364 --> 01:49:34,366
A hotel would have been fine.

1256
01:49:37,828 --> 01:49:42,374
We'll have to tell Mr. Greenleaf
how far his dollar stretched.

1257
01:49:45,752 --> 01:49:48,755
What's funny?

1258
01:49:48,839 --> 01:49:52,384
I was just thinking about when
Tom first came to Mongibello.

1259
01:49:54,428 --> 01:49:57,890
- And look at you now.
- Look at me what?

1260
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:01,143
To the manor born.

1261
01:50:15,282 --> 01:50:17,493
<i>Mr. Greenleaf?</i>

1262
01:50:21,371 --> 01:50:23,332
Mr. Greenleaf?

1263
01:50:23,373 --> 01:50:27,085
Tom. How are you?
You look well.

1264
01:50:27,169 --> 01:50:30,005
- Thank you, sir. I am well.
- Far cry from New York.

1265
01:50:30,047 --> 01:50:32,549
- Yes, it is.
- Marge.

1266
01:50:32,633 --> 01:50:35,677
Good morning.
Unusual weather.

1267
01:50:35,761 --> 01:50:38,639
- Very.
- And you, sir. Any better?

1268
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,809
Pretty good.
Sticking with hot water.

1269
01:50:41,892 --> 01:50:44,186
- Where's Mr. MacCarron?
- San Remo.

1270
01:50:44,269 --> 01:50:47,022
<i>The police are amateurs.</i>

1271
01:50:47,064 --> 01:50:51,610
<i>Well, my boy, it's come
to a pretty pass, hasn't it?</i>

1272
01:50:51,693 --> 01:50:54,863
What is the detective
hoping to find in San Remo?

1273
01:50:54,947 --> 01:50:59,785
<i>Hes being thorough.
Im learning about my son, Tom.</i>

1274
01:50:59,868 --> 01:51:03,288
Now he's missing,
I'm learning a great deal about him,

1275
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:06,458
and I hope that you can
fill in some more blanks for me.

1276
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:09,586
Marge has been good enough
to do that about Mongibello.

1277
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:13,465
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously,
I'll do anything to help Dickie.

1278
01:51:13,549 --> 01:51:16,009
<i>Good. This theory,</i>

1279
01:51:16,093 --> 01:51:18,220
<i>the letter
he left for you.</i>

1280
01:51:18,303 --> 01:51:21,557
<i>The police think that's
a clear indication...</i>

1281
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,394
he was planning on doing something,
uh, to himself.

1282
01:51:25,435 --> 01:51:28,230
I just don't believe that.

1283
01:51:28,313 --> 01:51:30,858
You don't want to, dear.

1284
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:36,071
I'd like
to talk to Tom alone.

1285
01:51:36,155 --> 01:51:38,949
<i>Perhaps this afternoon.
Would you mind?</i>

1286
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:45,414
Marge, what a man may say
to his sweetheart...

1287
01:51:45,497 --> 01:51:47,666
and what he'll admit
to another fellow--

1288
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:53,672
Such as?

1289
01:51:57,384 --> 01:52:00,637
What a waste of lives and opportunities.

1290
01:52:00,721 --> 01:52:03,724
I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
right now to shut up!

1291
01:52:12,065 --> 01:52:15,444
No, Marge doesn't
know the half of it.

1292
01:52:15,486 --> 01:52:18,780
And his passport photo.

1293
01:52:18,822 --> 01:52:21,700
Did you hear? To scratch out
his own face like that?

1294
01:52:21,825 --> 01:52:23,952
Can you imagine?

1295
01:52:24,036 --> 01:52:27,289
Frame of mind
you'd have to be in?

1296
01:52:27,372 --> 01:52:30,667
"I've thought about going to the police,
but I can't face it.

1297
01:52:30,751 --> 01:52:34,296
I can't face
anything anymore."

1298
01:52:34,338 --> 01:52:37,674
I feel guilty. I feel
like I pushed him away.

1299
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:39,802
I feel like I spoke
and he heard you.

1300
01:52:39,885 --> 01:52:42,679
Well,

1301
01:52:42,763 --> 01:52:45,349
if we all pushed him away,
what about him pushing us away?

1302
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:48,018
You've been a great friend
to my son.

1303
01:52:48,101 --> 01:52:51,230
Everything is
someone else's fault.

1304
01:52:51,313 --> 01:52:53,774
<i>We all want to sow
wild oats,</i>

1305
01:52:53,857 --> 01:52:57,152
but somebody's got to--
got to--

1306
01:52:57,236 --> 01:53:00,030
What is the word?

1307
01:53:00,113 --> 01:53:03,325
You know, the moment
someone confronts him,

1308
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:07,204
he lashes out.

1309
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:09,832
He always has.

1310
01:53:09,915 --> 01:53:13,794
You know, people always say
that you can't choose your parents,

1311
01:53:18,549 --> 01:53:21,009
but you can't choose
your children.

1312
01:53:22,386 --> 01:53:25,973
<i>Dickie.</i>

1313
01:53:26,056 --> 01:53:29,643
<i>You can be a leech.
You can be quite boring.</i>

1314
01:53:29,726 --> 01:53:31,645
- Stop it!
- It's boring.

1315
01:53:35,732 --> 01:53:38,068
<i>Stop, stop, stop!</i>

1316
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:41,488
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Tommy, Tommy.

1317
01:53:41,572 --> 01:53:43,490
<i>Like a little girl.</i>

1318
01:53:43,574 --> 01:53:46,660
Like a little girl.

1319
01:53:50,289 --> 01:53:52,249
Coming.

1320
01:53:52,332 --> 01:53:54,710
- Sorry. I was asleep.
- Finally.

1321
01:53:54,751 --> 01:53:56,879
- I must have fallen asleep.
- Did Dickie's dad go?

1322
01:53:56,962 --> 01:53:58,922
You look ghastly, Tom.
Did you have a nightmare?

1323
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:02,176
- He's having an early night.
- Oh, poor man.

1324
01:54:02,259 --> 01:54:04,720
<i>You know, we were banging
on that door forever.</i>

1325
01:54:08,307 --> 01:54:10,267
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1326
01:54:10,309 --> 01:54:13,896
- I think I've broken a strap.
- Not guilty.

1327
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:16,940
I'll fix some drinks.

1328
01:54:17,024 --> 01:54:19,651
Ah!
You walk in Venice.

1329
01:54:21,195 --> 01:54:23,113
Are you okay?

1330
01:54:24,615 --> 01:54:26,450
I'm fine.

1331
01:54:26,533 --> 01:54:30,704
- Did you want me to stick around?
- No, it's okay.

1332
01:54:32,748 --> 01:54:34,917
I could come back.

1333
01:54:50,265 --> 01:54:52,392
Your key.

1334
01:54:56,104 --> 01:54:58,774
<i>Tom?</i>

1335
01:54:58,857 --> 01:55:02,361
Marge, I'm in the bath.
I won't be long.

1336
01:55:02,444 --> 01:55:04,655
<i>Tom, I have to speak to you.
Its urgent.</i>

1337
01:55:08,408 --> 01:55:10,327
Coming.

1338
01:55:21,839 --> 01:55:25,134
- I found Dickie's rings.
- What?

1339
01:55:25,217 --> 01:55:27,219
You have Dickie's rings.

1340
01:55:32,015 --> 01:55:33,934
I can explain.

1341
01:55:34,017 --> 01:55:36,687
<i>Dickie promised me he would
never take off this ring.</i>

1342
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:39,815
Let me put some clothes on
and we'll talk about this.

1343
01:55:39,898 --> 01:55:42,317
- I have to tell Mr. Greenleaf.
- Marge, you're being hysterical.

1344
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:45,863
He promised me, "I swear, I will never
take off this ring until we get--"

1345
01:55:45,946 --> 01:55:47,865
Shut up!

1346
01:55:50,075 --> 01:55:53,537
I'm wet, Marge.
I've lost my towel.

1347
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:56,623
<i>And Id really like
to put some clothes on.</i>

1348
01:55:56,707 --> 01:55:58,709
Go and pour us both a drink.

1349
01:56:02,129 --> 01:56:04,047
Pour us a drink.

1350
01:56:37,414 --> 01:56:39,750
Marge?

1351
01:56:39,833 --> 01:56:42,085
Where are you going?

1352
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:45,631
I wasn't snooping.
I just--

1353
01:56:45,714 --> 01:56:48,634
I was looking for a needle
and thread to mend my bra.

1354
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:54,223
That scent you're wearing.

1355
01:56:54,306 --> 01:56:57,559
I bought that
for you.

1356
01:56:57,601 --> 01:57:00,187
The thing about Dickie--

1357
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:02,189
<i>So many things.</i>

1358
01:57:04,107 --> 01:57:07,694
That day when he was late
coming back from Rome,

1359
01:57:07,778 --> 01:57:09,696
I tried to tell you this.

1360
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:13,242
He was with another girl.
I'm not talking about Meredith, either.

1361
01:57:13,325 --> 01:57:16,578
Another girl
that we met in a bar.

1362
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:19,706
<i>He couldn't be faithful
for five minutes.</i>

1363
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:21,792
<i>So when he makes a promise,</i>

1364
01:57:21,875 --> 01:57:23,919
it doesn't mean what it means
when you make a promise...

1365
01:57:24,002 --> 01:57:26,588
or I make a promise.

1366
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:30,634
He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.

1367
01:57:30,717 --> 01:57:33,929
He lies. He lies.

1368
01:57:33,971 --> 01:57:38,392
And that's his-- Half the time
he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

1369
01:57:38,475 --> 01:57:41,770
And today,

1370
01:57:41,812 --> 01:57:45,607
I really started wondering whether
he may have killed Freddie.

1371
01:57:45,691 --> 01:57:49,278
<i>He would get so crazy
if anybody would contradict him.</i>

1372
01:57:49,361 --> 01:57:52,072
Well, you know that.
You know that.

1373
01:57:52,156 --> 01:57:54,783
<i>You know that.</i>

1374
01:57:54,825 --> 01:57:57,119
<i>And thats the irony, Marge.</i>

1375
01:57:57,161 --> 01:57:59,121
I loved you.

1376
01:57:59,163 --> 01:58:01,123
You may as well know, Marge.
I loved you.

1377
01:58:01,165 --> 01:58:03,917
<i>I dont know, maybe it's
grotesque of me to say this now,</i>

1378
01:58:04,001 --> 01:58:06,795
<i>so just... write it on apiece
of paper or something...</i>

1379
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:09,339
<i>and put it in your purse
for a rainy day.</i>

1380
01:58:09,423 --> 01:58:13,635
"Tom loves me. Tom loves me."

1381
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:16,096
- Why do you have Dickie's rings?
- I told you.

1382
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:19,266
- He gave them to me.
- Why? When?

1383
01:58:19,349 --> 01:58:22,352
<i>I feel as if you haven't been listening
to anything Ive been saying to you.</i>

1384
01:58:22,436 --> 01:58:25,689
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

1385
01:58:25,772 --> 01:58:28,108
- It's all true.
- I don't believe...

1386
01:58:28,192 --> 01:58:32,571
a single word you've said.

1387
01:58:32,654 --> 01:58:35,365
You're shivering, Marge.
Look at you.

1388
01:58:35,449 --> 01:58:39,244
<i>Marge, can I hold you?</i>

1389
01:58:39,328 --> 01:58:41,288
Will you let me hold you?

1390
01:58:41,371 --> 01:58:43,415
Marge?

1391
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:46,585
- Peter! Thank God you're here.
- Whats going on?

1392
01:58:46,668 --> 01:58:50,005
<i>Get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Please!</i>

1393
01:58:50,088 --> 01:58:54,927
Tom, are you okay?

1394
01:58:54,968 --> 01:58:58,096
You try.
You try talking to her.

1395
01:58:59,181 --> 01:59:01,266
- Tom?
- I give up.

1396
01:59:01,350 --> 01:59:03,936
<i>Tell me whats going on.
Tom!</i>

1397
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:06,480
- What did I ever do to her?
- Listen--

1398
01:59:06,563 --> 01:59:09,691
<i>Have her tell you one thing
that Ive ever done to her.</i>

1399
01:59:09,775 --> 01:59:12,444
You can't be angry
with her.

1400
01:59:12,528 --> 01:59:15,489
She's confused, and she needs
someone to blame.

1401
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:17,491
So she blames you.

1402
01:59:17,533 --> 01:59:20,119
I'll go back home
and talk to her.

1403
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:22,663
As for you,

1404
01:59:22,746 --> 01:59:25,374
either get a safety razor
or grow a beard.

1405
01:59:38,387 --> 01:59:41,557
- Is Mr. Greenleaf here?
- Mr. Ripley?

1406
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:44,309
- Yes.
- I'm Alvin MacCarron.

1407
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:49,690
<i>I dont know,
I dont know. I just know it.</i>

1408
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:52,693
<i>Marge, there's female
intuition and then there are facts.</i>

1409
01:59:55,279 --> 01:59:57,197
- Tom.
- Sir.

1410
01:59:57,281 --> 01:59:59,992
Marge, you should have waited.
I didn't--

1411
02:00:00,075 --> 02:00:02,744
<i>Didn't Peter say Id
come by and pick you up?</i>

1412
02:00:03,871 --> 02:00:06,498
Marge has been telling us
about the rings.

1413
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:09,042
<i>Yes, I feel ridiculous
I didn't mention them yesterday.</i>

1414
02:00:09,126 --> 02:00:11,545
I clean forgot.
Ridiculous.

1415
02:00:14,131 --> 02:00:18,427
Perhaps you didn't mention them because
there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

1416
02:00:20,512 --> 02:00:23,765
<i>Im going to take Marge for a walk.
Tom, Mr. MacCarron needs to talk to you.</i>

1417
02:00:23,849 --> 02:00:26,059
There's no need. We could go
to the bar. There's no need.

1418
02:00:26,143 --> 02:00:28,353
No, no.

1419
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:30,689
<i>I think you should
stay here.</i>

1420
02:00:52,544 --> 02:00:55,005
I could probably
see my room from here.

1421
02:00:55,088 --> 02:00:57,049
I can see my house.

1422
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:03,180
When you see where you live from a
distance, it's like a dream, isn't it?

1423
02:01:03,263 --> 02:01:05,516
I don't care for B.S.

1424
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:08,227
I don't care to hear it.
I don't care to speak it.

1425
02:01:10,437 --> 02:01:12,731
- Okay.
- Did you know that at Princeton...

1426
02:01:12,773 --> 02:01:15,108
Dickie Greenleaf
half-killed a boy?

1427
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:18,195
<i>At a party over some girl.</i>

1428
02:01:18,278 --> 02:01:22,157
<i>Kicked the kid several times
in the head, put him in the hospital.</i>

1429
02:01:22,241 --> 02:01:26,078
Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw,
lost some hearing.

1430
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:29,414
<i>Why do you think Dickie's father
sent him to Europe in the first place?</i>

1431
02:01:32,126 --> 02:01:36,338
The Rome police didn't think
to ask Mr. Greenleaf.

1432
02:01:36,421 --> 02:01:39,383
Nor did they think to check
on whether a Thomas Ripley...

1433
02:01:39,466 --> 02:01:42,636
<i>had ever been a student
at Princeton University.</i>

1434
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:47,349
Oh, I turned up
a Tom Ripley...

1435
02:01:47,432 --> 02:01:51,520
who had been a piano tuner
in the music department.

1436
02:01:52,604 --> 02:01:54,690
You see, in America,

1437
02:01:54,773 --> 02:01:59,278
we are taught to check a fact
before it becomes a fact.

1438
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:01,780
We're taught to nose around.

1439
02:02:01,822 --> 02:02:04,700
When a girl drowns herself,

1440
02:02:04,783 --> 02:02:07,161
find out if
that girl is pregnant.

1441
02:02:07,244 --> 02:02:10,164
<i>Find out if Dickie
had an embarrassment there.</i>

1442
02:02:11,582 --> 02:02:14,960
Mr. Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
He really does.

1443
02:02:15,002 --> 02:02:18,088
Marge--
She has a hundred theories.

1444
02:02:18,172 --> 02:02:21,091
There are a few things
that she doesn't know.

1445
02:02:21,175 --> 02:02:23,135
We hope she never knows.

1446
02:02:23,218 --> 02:02:25,471
I hope she never knows.

1447
02:02:25,512 --> 02:02:28,015
Three different people...

1448
02:02:28,098 --> 02:02:31,643
saw Dickie
get into Freddie's car.

1449
02:02:31,727 --> 02:02:35,022
One man,
who will not testify...

1450
02:02:35,105 --> 02:02:38,025
because he was jumping somebody
else's wife at the time,

1451
02:02:38,108 --> 02:02:42,112
saw Dickie removing license plates
from a red sports car.

1452
02:02:42,196 --> 02:02:46,158
The police know about this man because
he happens to be a policeman.

1453
02:02:48,202 --> 02:02:51,663
I found these in the basement
of Dickie's apartment.

1454
02:02:51,747 --> 02:02:53,832
They belong to Freddie's car.

1455
02:02:53,916 --> 02:02:58,212
Mr. Greenleaf has asked me...

1456
02:02:58,295 --> 02:03:01,173
to lose these in the canal
this evening.

1457
02:03:06,386 --> 02:03:09,223
Mr. Greenleaf feels that
there was a silent promise...

1458
02:03:09,306 --> 02:03:12,476
in Dickie's letter to you
which he intends to honor.

1459
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:15,103
<i>He also intends to transfer
a good portion...</i>

1460
02:03:15,187 --> 02:03:19,900
of Dickie's income from his trust
into your name.

1461
02:03:19,983 --> 02:03:22,069
<i>He does not intend...</i>

1462
02:03:22,152 --> 02:03:25,614
<i>to give the Italians any
information about Dickie's past.</i>

1463
02:03:27,574 --> 02:03:31,370
He's rather hoping that...
you will feel the same.

1464
02:03:49,429 --> 02:03:51,348
- Thank you so much, Tom.
- Sir.

1465
02:03:51,431 --> 02:03:53,350
Good-bye.

1466
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:02,276
Marge, I feel I never should have said
those things to you the other evening.

1467
02:04:02,359 --> 02:04:06,363
I was pretty flustered,
and the rings-- And you looked so--

1468
02:04:06,446 --> 02:04:08,740
I don't know.

1469
02:04:08,782 --> 02:04:12,870
But I hope that note goes
in your purse to New York...

1470
02:04:12,953 --> 02:04:15,414
for a rainy day.

1471
02:04:16,957 --> 02:04:20,669
- What are you gonna do now, Tom?
- I don't know.

1472
02:04:20,752 --> 02:04:22,880
Peter has a concert in Athens
next month,

1473
02:04:22,963 --> 02:04:25,549
so he asked me to come along
and help out.

1474
02:04:28,135 --> 02:04:30,053
He says good-bye.

1475
02:04:30,137 --> 02:04:32,097
By the way, he was
in rehearsal so he couldn't--

1476
02:04:32,139 --> 02:04:36,351
Why do I think there's
never been a Ripley rainy day?

1477
02:04:36,435 --> 02:04:39,021
What?

1478
02:04:39,104 --> 02:04:42,816
I know it was you.
I know it was you.

1479
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:45,736
I know it was you!
I know it was you!

1480
02:04:45,819 --> 02:04:49,448
- Marge, Marge. Please!
- I know you killed Dickie!

1481
02:04:49,531 --> 02:04:51,450
- Marge!
- I know! No!

1482
02:04:51,533 --> 02:04:55,037
I know it was you!

1483
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,122
Marge.
Marge, please.

1484
02:04:57,206 --> 02:04:59,875
It's not Tom.
Really.

1485
02:05:08,467 --> 02:05:11,720
<i>We are called gondoleri</i>

1486
02:05:11,804 --> 02:05:15,766
<i>But thats a vagary
Its quite honorary</i>

1487
02:05:15,974 --> 02:05:21,230
The trade that we ply

1488
02:05:21,355 --> 02:05:24,107
Ask me what I want to change
about this moment.

1489
02:05:24,191 --> 02:05:26,652
I don't know. What do you want
to change about this moment?

1490
02:05:26,693 --> 02:05:28,403
Nothing.

1491
02:05:32,074 --> 02:05:34,868
I'm freezing. Coming down?

1492
02:05:34,952 --> 02:05:37,788
Later. I want
to catch the sunset.

1493
02:05:37,871 --> 02:05:42,126
- You're mad.
- I am.

1494
02:05:52,052 --> 02:05:53,971
<i>Dickie?</i>

1495
02:05:57,182 --> 02:05:59,101
<i>Dickie?</i>

1496
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:04,439
<i>Dickie!</i>

1497
02:06:15,534 --> 02:06:17,453
Oh, my God.

1498
02:06:19,413 --> 02:06:21,373
Hello, Meredith.

1499
02:06:24,501 --> 02:06:26,837
I was looking at you.

1500
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:30,340
<i>Your clothes.
I wouldn't have known you.</i>

1501
02:06:30,424 --> 02:06:33,177
<i>Well, you spotted me,
so you get the reward.</i>

1502
02:06:34,845 --> 02:06:37,514
- What?
-Just kidding.

1503
02:06:37,598 --> 02:06:41,560
- Are you alone?
- Oh.

1504
02:06:41,602 --> 02:06:44,646
<i>Hardly.
Couldn't be less alone.</i>

1505
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:47,399
- Aunt Joan.
- And "co."

1506
02:06:50,527 --> 02:06:52,488
A lot of "co."

1507
02:06:53,614 --> 02:06:56,742
Oh, God.

1508
02:06:56,825 --> 02:06:59,912
<i>You know, seeing you again, I--</i>

1509
02:07:01,997 --> 02:07:05,292
I've thought about you...

1510
02:07:05,334 --> 02:07:07,294
so much.

1511
02:07:07,336 --> 02:07:09,296
And I've thought about you.

1512
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:14,802
Yeah, well, when I've thought about you,
I was mostly hating you.

1513
02:07:21,391 --> 02:07:23,352
Where have you been hiding?

1514
02:07:23,435 --> 02:07:26,939
I haven't been hiding.

1515
02:07:27,022 --> 02:07:29,358
I've been in police custody.

1516
02:07:30,692 --> 02:07:33,654
They've been trying to
flush out Freddie's killer.

1517
02:07:33,695 --> 02:07:36,907
- You're kidding.
- They're giving me this vacation,

1518
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:39,284
which is why
the getup.

1519
02:07:39,326 --> 02:07:41,495
Which is why
you haven't heard from me.

1520
02:07:41,578 --> 02:07:43,872
You know, the whole world
thinks you killed Freddie.

1521
02:07:43,956 --> 02:07:47,042
- Oh! It's terrible.
- I know.

1522
02:07:47,126 --> 02:07:49,837
Listen, I can't
talk now. Um, later?

1523
02:07:53,799 --> 02:07:57,177
Later? Later?

1524
02:08:07,396 --> 02:08:09,356
So--

1525
02:08:14,611 --> 02:08:17,281
Are you traveling
under "R"?

1526
02:08:17,364 --> 02:08:20,409
You know what? I am.

1527
02:08:23,495 --> 02:08:27,875
Dickie, are you with Peter
Smith-Kingsley? I bet you are.

1528
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:30,544
My aunt
thought she saw him.

1529
02:08:30,627 --> 02:08:32,754
Peter Smith-Kingsley?
No, I--

1530
02:08:32,838 --> 02:08:36,467
I haven't seen him
in months.

1531
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:38,469
No, I'm alone.

1532
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:00,199
Hi.

1533
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:05,412
- How was it?
- It was good.

1534
02:09:05,496 --> 02:09:07,414
But I'll tell you something.

1535
02:09:07,498 --> 02:09:11,251
I want us to stay in here
for the rest of the trip.

1536
02:09:15,798 --> 02:09:18,550
Was that Meredith?

1537
02:09:20,052 --> 02:09:21,970
Was who Meredith?

1538
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:25,766
Meredith Logue. You were kissing
someone. It looked like Meredith.

1539
02:09:32,481 --> 02:09:35,984
I came out to find you.

1540
02:09:36,068 --> 02:09:38,487
Oh, hardly kissing.

1541
02:09:39,905 --> 02:09:43,033
- Kissing off.
- It didn't look that way.

1542
02:09:44,535 --> 02:09:46,578
You know?
From a distance?

1543
02:09:51,542 --> 02:09:54,211
I lied... to her.

1544
02:09:55,462 --> 02:09:58,090
<i>She thought she'd seen you.</i>

1545
02:09:58,132 --> 02:10:00,092
Why lie?

1546
02:10:00,134 --> 02:10:05,097
Dickie and Peter
together. Thats just too good gossip.

1547
02:10:05,139 --> 02:10:07,099
Or Tom and Peter, even.

1548
02:10:07,141 --> 02:10:09,685
That would be
even better gossip.

1549
02:10:09,768 --> 02:10:12,020
Really? Why?

1550
02:10:16,859 --> 02:10:21,321
I-I, um--
I'm completely lost.

1551
02:10:23,991 --> 02:10:25,909
I know.

1552
02:10:27,202 --> 02:10:30,330
I'm sorry, Peter.

1553
02:10:30,414 --> 02:10:32,374
I'm lost.

1554
02:10:35,502 --> 02:10:38,881
I'm gonna be stuck
in the basement, aren't I?

1555
02:10:38,964 --> 02:10:42,259
<i>Aren't I?</i>

1556
02:10:42,342 --> 02:10:44,261
That's my--

1557
02:10:47,347 --> 02:10:49,308
Terrible...

1558
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:52,728
and alone...

1559
02:10:52,811 --> 02:10:56,231
and dark.

1560
02:10:56,315 --> 02:10:59,026
And I've lied...

1561
02:10:59,067 --> 02:11:02,154
about who I am...

1562
02:11:02,237 --> 02:11:04,239
and where I am.

1563
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:06,825
Now no one'll ever find me.

1564
02:11:08,410 --> 02:11:10,746
What do you mean,
lied about who you are?

1565
02:11:10,829 --> 02:11:13,499
I always thought
it'd be better...

1566
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:16,668
to be a fake somebody...

1567
02:11:16,710 --> 02:11:19,671
than a real nobody.

1568
02:11:19,713 --> 02:11:22,591
<i>What are you talking about?
You're not a nobody.</i>

1569
02:11:22,674 --> 02:11:25,177
That's the last thing
you are.

1570
02:11:32,601 --> 02:11:36,188
<i>Peter.</i>

1571
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:38,816
Tell me some good things
about Tom Ripley.

1572
02:11:40,692 --> 02:11:43,320
No, don't get up.
Don't get up. Don't get up.

1573
02:11:46,281 --> 02:11:48,200
Just--

1574
02:11:50,994 --> 02:11:54,748
Just tell me some nice things...
about Tom Ripley.

1575
02:11:57,835 --> 02:12:00,921
"Good things
about Tom Ripley."

1576
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,050
That could take me
some time.

1577
02:12:07,594 --> 02:12:11,473
Tom is talented.
Tom is tender.

1578
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:14,852
Tom is beautiful.

1579
02:12:14,893 --> 02:12:17,354
You're such a liar.

1580
02:12:20,649 --> 02:12:24,027
Tom is--
Tom is a mystery.

1581
02:12:29,616 --> 02:12:32,161
<i>Tom is not a nobody.</i>

1582
02:12:35,789 --> 02:12:39,668
<i>Tom has secrets
he doesn't want to tell me,</i>

1583
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:42,087
<i>and I wish he would.</i>

1584
02:12:46,258 --> 02:12:48,719
<i>Tom has nightmares.</i>

1585
02:12:52,764 --> 02:12:55,225
<i>Thats not a good thing.</i>

1586
02:12:59,813 --> 02:13:02,399
<i>Tom has someone to love him.</i>

1587
02:13:03,984 --> 02:13:06,403
<i>That is a good thing.</i>

1588
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:13,702
<i>Mmm.
Tom is crushing me.</i>

1589
02:13:13,786 --> 02:13:17,164
<i>Tom is crushing me.</i>

1590
02:13:17,247 --> 02:13:21,084
<i>Tom. Tom, you're crush--</i>

1591
02:13:21,126 --> 02:13:24,046
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1592
02:13:24,087 --> 02:13:25,964
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1593
02:13:26,048 --> 02:13:27,966
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1594
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:37,601
<i>Oh, God! Peter.</i>
