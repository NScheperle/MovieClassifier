Hey.
What did you say?

4
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,000
You teach him that?

5
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,210
He heard it
in the locker room, Dad.

6
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:40,504
<i>- From who?
- Everyone.</i>

10

- I don't know. I'll ask Tinker.

11
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,022
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

12
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:02,107
Take the sled, will ya?
I wanna wait for the mail.

13
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,026
- The magazine's supposed to be here, express.
- Okay. Better be good.

14
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:06,570
Of course it's gonna be good.
That's the whole point.

15

I don't exactly trust
Chuckie boy.

16

Fat men don't shovel,
Bailey.

No, it's dry.
It's dry.

- Hey, is the magazine out yet?
- Monday.

32
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,167
- Johnny's supposed to get a copy expressed.
- Maybe we made the cover.

33
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,339
- We ain't on the cover.
- He said it would be a big story with pictures.

34
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,132
<i>Yeah, Chuck exaggerates.</i>

35

Hey, guys, you are
not gonna believe this.

36
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:09,641
Sarah Heinz.

37
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:13,144
I know!
She's supposed to be this shy girl.

38

<i>I figure, what the hell.
I ain't that attractive.</i>

39
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:19,650
I'll vaccinate her quick, get home for an
early sack, beat what's left of the bishop.

40
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,652
Like this?

41
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,696
- She's much fatter naked. Yeah!
- No.

42
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,533
I'm telling you, she got her February
fat now in the second week in December.

43
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:30,827
She's riding me

- What?

49
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,926
- You kill one more wolf...
- Ain't no sheriffin' in here.

50
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,886
I ain't sheriffin'. I'm just

<i>Come on, boys.
Let's move it.</i>

52
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:54,682
It's two tenths below zero.
The committee won't be happy.

53
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:59,353
- The committee.
- You seen Weeks lately? He's been skating the river.

54
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,273
<i>I don't care. I'm about to be on

<i>That photographer said I have
one of those expressive faces.</i>

56
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:13,074
- A face that tells a story.
- Too bad it's a tragedy.

57
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,827
- A comedy.
- A horror story.

58
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,662
Come on, guys.
Let's start gettin' our heads into it.

59
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:23,667
Like Connor says,
that Weeks kid, he's got jump.

60
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,962
I'm tellin' you, Tree,
there's rumors.

61
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:29,256
One of us is going down.

Stretch 'em out.

66

<i>- Line 'em up, Michael!

68
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:21,303
- I win no matter what side, huh?
- Win this, Tree.

69
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:29,519
- Maybe it's you and me, huh?
- Winetka.

70
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:31,104
Here.

71
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,231

- Chump.

75
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,188
You think
we gotta do it?

76
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,529
- Birdie!
- Try and pass me!

77
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:28,240

83

There are things you do in public...

Very effective, Walter.

88
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,995
Nipped in the bud.

153
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,913
Oh, Skank.

154
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,219
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

155
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,347
<i>"On the left side,</i>

156
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,183
Skank Marden is a master
of sticky sores... "

157
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,143
No, no, Shawnette.

158
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,979
Um, remember, you want
to sound out the words.

159
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,981
- Okay.
- Let's try again.

160
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:40,818
"Skank Marden,
a master of the stick,

161
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,695
scores on demand. "

162
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>That's right. Good. Excellent.</i>

163
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:50,535
Tommy! What?

164
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,955
Word is Biebe is out
and Weeks is going up.

165
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,706
Really?

166
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,296
- Don't get too far.
- Yeah, Dad.

167
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:07,342
<i>- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.</i>

168
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:11,805
Thanks for coming, Johnny.

169
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:20,771
Well, we can't hold
Stevie Weeks back any longer.

170
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,732
You'll be first alternate,
of course.

171
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:28,904
That's...

172
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,410
There's more to the game than speed,
Scott. Experience counts.

173
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,705
Which Stevie Weeks can't get
till we call him up.

174
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,167
You've been in the Saturday game
13 years, Johnny.

175
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:48,046
- That's a record!
- I can still play.

176
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,674
When was the last time
you scored a goal?

177
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,555
Look, it's not fair to the Weeks boy
to keep him back.

178
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,767
<i>And it's not fair
to the Saturday game.</i>

179
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:17,365
Shit!

180
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,141
<i>I gotta go.</i>

181
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:04,032
Donna's inside, Johnny.

182
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:10,413
- Hey.
- Hey.

183
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,883
I'm fine, Donna.

184
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:31,558
We talked about this.

185
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:36,771
We knew one day eventually...
I'm fine.

186
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,814
Don't tell me you're fine.

187
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,704
I better check on Mike.

188
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:23,647
<i>- You could've told me.
- I can't give you that kind of information.</i>

189
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:26,608
We're sleeping together,
for God's sakes.

190
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:30,320
Skank, we're committing adultery. It's
not like I threw in trust as a perk.

191
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,614
<i>Honey.</i>

192
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:36,659
- Hi.
- Look, you, uh... you may have heard.

193
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,786
- We just did it.
- I heard.

194
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:41,330
And so did I,
and it's a big mistake.

195
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:44,917
John Biebe is the anchor,
for God's sakes!

196
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:48,878
Geez.

197
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:55,843
<i>Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!</i>

198
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:59,263
Guys, it ain't my birthday.

199
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,473
It's better.
You're in the Saturday game!

200
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,726
L- I could go down
as fast as I come up.

201
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:08,730
- There's no way.
- Hey, I'm next. They'll be callin' me next.

202
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,280
Hey, Mike.

203
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:21,742
- Hey.
- Why don't you get yourself that milkshake?

204
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,671
Better not hear
your grades are dropping off.

205
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:39,508
They-They won't, sir.

206
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:44,012
You skate like you can
and you'll be fine.

207
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,851
- Boys.
- Sheriff.

208
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,730
<i>- I ordered one for you too, Dad.
- Thanks, Mike.</i>

209
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,773
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

210
00:18:55,898 --> 00:19:00,236
You gotta get out to Gagney Grocers.
Connor Banks just shot a guy.

211
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:07,117
Ow! Jesus!
What, did you put your finger in it?

212
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:09,369
<i>- Try and hold still.
- Could you jam the oxygen tank...</i>

213
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,371
<i>a little further up my ass, please?</i>

214
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:14,123
<i>Have you done this before?</i>

215
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,252
- Who is he?
- A rep from Price World.

216
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,337
<i>Good. Twist it! Yeah, that helps.</i>

217
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:23,841
<i>Think about trimming
those nails too, Tarzan.</i>

218
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:26,760
<i>- Just try to hold it there.
- Are you trying to hurt me?</i>

219
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:28,845
Huh?

220
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,389
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

221
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:34,559
Do I look like I'm okay?
The fucker shot me!

222
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:38,437
What the fuck-ass fuck of a bum-fuck,
shithole town is this?

223
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:41,106
<i>I make a business call.
I give him my card.</i>

224
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:45,360
And the hick-ass fucker shoots
my foot off! Cock-fucking shit!

225
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,825
- John, it was an accident.
- You read him his rights?

226
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,911
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, come on, John!

227
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:57,371
- I didn't mean to shoot him.
- Call Bailey Pruitt. Talk to him.

228
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,331
Don't be saying
anything to me.

229
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,458
<i>Johnny, I heard.</i>

230
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:06,421
- I'm sorry.
- Connor, you just shot a guy.

231
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,340
- Take him.
- Read him his rights.

232
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,759
<i>Cock-fucking suck-ass fucker!</i>

233
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,970
<i>Have fun in jail, asshole!</i>

234
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:16,222
They, uh,
got into a beef.

235
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,892
<i>- Connor pulled a pistol.
Happened over in feed.</i>

236
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:24,021
Says he was aiming at a sack
of Puppy Chow, trying to scare him.

237
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,148
He hit a wheelbarrow.
It ricocheted.

238
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:29,317
<i>- Ow! Ow, ow!
- Johnny?</i>

239
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:33,738
- Yeah?
- There's a helicopter hovering over town hall. Looks Russian.

240
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,055
Whoa!

241
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,849
I'm slow in the feet?

242
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,435
That's it?
That's all you got for me?

243
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,356
<i>No, "Wow, nice helicopter"? No, " Hey,
great article in Sports Illustrated"?</i>

244
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,483
How's Donna doing?
Does she miss me?

245
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,611
Twice in one year, Charlie.
What do you want this time?

246
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:22,199
I come bearing
the New York Rangers.

247
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,536
The New York Rangers?

248
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,289
Yeah, I was pretty blown away myself.

249
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,292
But the article sparked some kind
of brainstorm at the NHL.

250
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,379
<i>- Good writing, I guess.
- The New York Rangers.</i>

251
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,422
The New York Rangers.

252
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,966
- In Mystery, Alaska?
- Right here.

253
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,926
To play against our boys?

254
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,012
The NHL feels it'll be
great publicity,

255
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,266
and the network figures
a 14 share, minimum.

256
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,851
All right.

257
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:54,270
What's in it for you,
Charlie?

258
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,397
Community pride.

259
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,566
A sense of giving back to
the place where I grew up.

260
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,196
Money.

261
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:15,706
If you all settle down, we'll, uh,
we'll try to answer all your questions.

262
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:18,000
Now, nothing is definite.

263
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,795
There's still some dealing to be done
with the players' unions and things.

264
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:25,299
But what needs to be decided first is,
do we want this game?

265
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:29,594
<i>- I won't kid ya, it would be
a goose to the economy.</i>

266
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,888
<i>What economy?</i>

267
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,308
We can be serious
about this,

268
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:39,103
or we can simply leave the decision to
the committee, which I'm quite happy to do.

269
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,355
Yes, Miram?

270
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,776
The question is,
do we really stand a chance?

271
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:48,778
<i>'Cause if all that's gonna happen
is we'll get laughed at,</i>

272
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:51,322
I'm not for it
at any price.

273
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,741
That's fair. That's fair.
And to answer that,

274
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:57,244
I'd like to call up here
someone we all know and...

275
00:22:57,453 --> 00:23:01,457
Well, we all know.
Charles Danner.

276
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:11,549
Thanks. Um... Well, first of all,
it's really great to be back.

277
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:15,052
<i>Bullshit!</i>

278
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,763
<i>Uh... Um, here's the thing.</i>

279
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:20,933
On a standard ice rink,
no, we don't come close.

280
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,560
But... our boys on a pond?

281
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,521
<i>Now, hold on
just one second.</i>

282
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:31,192
You're using words
like "we" and "our boys. "

283
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:33,361
You left this town,
Charlie Danner.

284
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:37,323
You can't even skate.

285
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:42,536
Plus, this may be
an old lady talking,

286
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,539
but I've always thought
you were a bit of a prick.

287
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,877
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is a town meeting.</i>

288
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:54,922
Let's have some order,
for God's sakes! John.

289
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:57,174
<i>Could we make a game of it?</i>

290
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:59,218
<i>Yeah, John.</i>

291
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,727
Depends on rules.

292
00:24:08,852 --> 00:24:10,770
We play four on four.
They play five on five.

293
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:12,772
<i>Boards, offsides,
two-line passing.</i>

294
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:15,983
Rules that keep everything bunched.
It's a different kind of game.

295
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,903
<i>John, excuse me, but this game
is gonna be played on a pond.</i>

296
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:20,946
- Hey, Chuck...
- One second.

297
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:24,449
Everybody here always says on a pond,
nobody beats us, right? Nobody.

298
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:27,911
Okay, well, you got a chance
to prove it now.

299
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:30,789
John, can we win?

300
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:37,545
Shooting, passing, stick handling...
The truth?

301
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,923
Except for Connor,
nobody here comes close.

302
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,758
Except for Connor,
nobody here comes close.

303
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,718
<i>But on the pond,</i>

304
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:48,597
black ice, wide open surface,
it's all about skating.

305
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:50,890
And we can skate.

306
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:54,852
Yeah, we can.
All right, man.

307
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:05,904
The New York Rangers
are professionals.

308
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,241
<i>Two things we've always had
in Mystery:</i>

309
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,581
Our dignity
and our illusions.

310
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:20,292
I suggest we cling to both.

311
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,974
Where's the dignity
in not trying?

312
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:42,604
I'll play those Rangers.

313
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:49,277
- I'm in.
- I'll play.

314
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:53,281
I'll beat 'em.

315
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:03,832
<i>As mayor of Mystery, Alaska,</i>

316
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:07,210
I'm gonna extend a little invitation
to the New York Rangers!

317
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,944
Hey, Johnny!

318
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:39,115
- This can't wait till tomorrow?
- No, no, we gotta be on the ice at sunup.

319
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,909
If this game happens,
it's only 32 days away.

320
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,286
<i>We gotta get goin'.</i>

321
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:47,581
- I bet you're back on the team now, right?
- Maybe.

322
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,083
Well, they're not gonna play the Rangers
with just ten guys.

323
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,127
Here he comes.

324
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,171
- John. Hey, Donna.
- Hey, Scott.

325
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:57,590
- Witch-tit cold, huh?
- Yeah.

326
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,509
Look, John,
these are the developments.

327
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:03,554
Things have changed.
We want you to coach.

328
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:06,681
Judge turn you down?

329
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,934
Yeah.
He's got some bug up his colon.

330
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,729
But next toJudge Fuck Nut,
you know most about hockey.

331
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:15,398
Scott, you'll need him
to play, right?

332
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:17,483
Oh, uh...

333
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:21,570
Well, the committee feels you can best
help the team by, you know, coaching.

334
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:24,156
You're the guy.
They all look up to you.

335
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:27,200
Scott, I don't coach.

336
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:30,870
John, I'm asking you
as mayor of the town.

337
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:32,789
Will you coach?

338
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,752
<i>Look, think about it.</i>

339
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:39,837
Let me know, huh?

340
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:44,132
You know,

341
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:48,762
every ex-player turned coach says
they prefer coaching to playing.

342
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,181
Why would they
all say that?

343
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:54,058
Because they can't play.

344
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:02,983
So why'd you wanna come?
You never wanna come when I plough.

345
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:05,402
- Well, um, could you pull over?
- Sure.

346
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:17,621
What...
What are you doing?

347
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:19,665
Um...

348
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,377
I thought, um...

349
00:28:23,544 --> 00:28:26,421
I think we should celebrate
you making the team.

350
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:30,550
N- Now? Here?

351
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,136
I don't know where else
to do it.

352
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:35,263
I got a condom too.

353
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:38,599
- So...
- Marla.

354
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:42,311
With you on the team, Stevie,
a lot of girls are gonna be,

355
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,355
you know, after you.

356
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:54,739
I don't wanna lose you toJody Lange
just 'cause she gives.

357
00:28:56,657 --> 00:28:59,535
Marla.

358
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:03,330
I'm not gonna leave you
on account of not having sex.

359
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:08,251
I love you.

360
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:24,057
Are you sure?

361
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:27,060
Yeah, I'm sure.

362
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,264
Oh!

363
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,269
Oh, I'm-I'm...
I'm sorry.

364
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:17,565
That's okay. That's...
That's okay.

365
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:21,193
L...
Does this mean we're done?

366
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,279
I'm-I'm sorry.
I must have...

367
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,365
That's okay.

368
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:32,829
It's okay, Stevie.

369
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:05,442
Hey, Sarah, sorry to be calling on you
so late, but have you heard?

370
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,571
- The Rangers?
- Yeah.

371
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:13,366
Yeah, good news makes
the compass point north.

372
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:15,576
How about a quick rattle?

373
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:18,954
After you, Skank.

374
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:31,925
"Mother walrus going
thwap, thwap, thwap"?

375
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,011
- What?
- You wanna hear a thwap?

376
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:57,031
Women don't like being referred to
as fat mammals, Skank.

377
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,702
I never would've said that
to her face.

378
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:05,622
- Are you gonna arrest me?
- Do you want me to?

379
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:09,250
Well, if it's all over what he said, I'd
just as soon it'd be all over that I hit him.

380
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:12,879
It will be.

381
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:22,221
<i>You gonna let the kids keep the school?</i>

382
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:24,223
<i>We gotta have a new rink, Donna.</i>

383
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,601
You want one of those goddamn
TV trucks to fall through the ice?

384
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:32,105
Plus we need new boards, lights,
and they're sending us a Zamboni.

385
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,900
Oh, a Zamboni.
Gettin' wet just thinking about it.

386
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,902
Jesus!

387
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:46,535
- Donna. Hey.
- Hey.

388
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,620
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hi. Good.

389
00:32:48,787 --> 00:32:50,663
- How are you?
- I'm good.

390
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:53,207
- You ran out before I could say hi last night.
- I know. Hi.

391
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:55,418
Hi.
God, you look good.

392
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:58,087
How can you look this good? What do
you have, like nine children now?

393
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:00,381
All right, well,
we're not the Partridge Family.

394
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:03,509
- Three kids.
- I know how many kids you have.

395
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:06,803
So, you're a producer, huh?

396
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:08,930
Yeah, well,
associate producer.

397
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,224
What's a producer do?

398
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:13,393
Uh, well,
I'm-I'm doing it.

399
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:16,771
- Really?
- Yes, I'm liaising with the locals.

400
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:19,023
I see.

401
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:21,442
And the helicopter was...

402
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:25,737
Well, you know, it's the kind of news
you wanna deliver in person, you know,

403
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:29,407
and I can't help it if it impressed
the hell out of you.

404
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:35,079
So, uh...
Well, so did it?

405
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,249
Do I look impressed?

406
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,919
You look good.

407
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:49,968
Your Honor,

408
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:54,055
at this time I'd be asking the court
to dismiss the charges...

409
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:57,308
<i>on the grounds of patriotism.</i>

410
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:59,602
I'm not in the mood,
Mr. Pruitt.

411
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:05,399
If Price World
did come here...

412
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,235
with the one-stop shopping
and the low, low prices,

413
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,405
it would threaten to put every merchant
in this town out of business,

414
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,073
<i>as it has in so many communities
across this country.</i>

415
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,617
- Trial date?
- This Tuesday.

416
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:19,203
Tuesday?

417
00:34:19,328 --> 00:34:22,706
- Fine by me.
- All right, next Tuesday.

418
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:24,750
And impanel Monday.

419
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,840
I don't want a trial now. Suppose I
lose? I get jail, I miss the game.

420
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:34,425
Connor, trust me. They're not gonna
lock up our leading scorer.

421
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:41,557
As the puck comes off the ice,
the left wing will always drop back.

422
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:45,560
These four swing around here,
try and force the puck this way.

423
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:49,314
So the puck carrier is
always facing three defensemen.

424
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,524
<i>- Are we gonna play it?
- No.</i>

425
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:53,484
We're gonna learn it
so we can beat it.

426
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:56,279
It's five-man, not four.
It's complicated.

427
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,781
Before we get into that,

428
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:04,286
There's one rule we got we live by.

429
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:06,872
What happens in this room,

430
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,499
what's said in this room,
stays in this room.

431
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,670
Now, last night Skank
took a shovel to the temple...

432
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:15,880
<i>because somebody repeated what
was said in the locker room.</i>

433
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,841
<i>Somebody repeated
to Silvie Walker,</i>

434
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:22,011
<i>and Silvie Walker
repeated it to Sarah Heinz.</i>

435
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:31,394
- I told her confidentially.
- Aw, Jesus.

436
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,522
What you say in the room
stay in the room.

437
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:36,482
I didn't think she
was gonna say anything.

438
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,070
Skank, I'm sorry.

439
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:45,240
She just smoked the hog, man.
I wasn't myself.

440
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:51,371
- It's your call, Skank.
- Oh, I want it.

441
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:53,373
Fuck!

442
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,251
<i>Fuckin' wind-chill. This ain't right.</i>

443
00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:00,337
It's not that easy!

444
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:04,383
<i>- One slip of the tongue. All right, that's it.
- Rules are rules!</i>

445
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,428
Come on, guys!

446
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:11,389
- Do it!
- Come on!

447
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:13,224
Aw, shit!

448
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:34,452
Oh, shit!
Mother...

449
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:40,249
<i>I hate you bastards!
I hate you all!</i>

450
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:44,127
All I did was suggest we meet,
and then he pulled out a gun.

451
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:46,129
Did he say anything,
Mr. Walsh?

452
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:48,798
Objection!
Now, that question...

453
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:54,846
Fuck it.

454
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,682
What did he say?

455
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:02,102
Well, he conveyed his anger at the idea
of Price World moving into the community.

456
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:06,148
<i>He threatened to shoot me if I didn't
leave the premises, and then he shot me.</i>

457
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,984
Thank you, Mr. Walsh.
Reserve the right to recall, Your Honor.

458
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:14,947
Big doings we've got going here
in Mystery these days, huh?

459
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:18,325
<i>Price World wants to come here,</i>

460
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:21,078
and now the New York Rangers
want to come.

461
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:25,832
Mr. Pruitt, I don't want to hear
anything about Price World.

462
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:29,919
I don't wanna hear another word about
a hockey game. We talked about this.

463
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:32,755
Yeah, well, forgive me, Your Honor.
I'm fat.

464
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:40,679
Mr. Walsh, that bullet
that struck you,

465
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:43,974
did it appear to ricochet
off a wheelbarrow?

466
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:46,351
It... Maybe.
So what?

467
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:51,481
Is it legal to shoot in the vicinity
of people in this town?

468
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:54,275
You don't care very much for
our community, do you, Mr. Walsh?

469
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:57,987
<i>- I have nothing against
your community, Mr. Pruitt.</i>

470
00:37:58,154 --> 00:37:59,947
Did you say,

471
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:04,326
"What the fuck-ass fuck
of a bum-fuck shithole town is this?"

472
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:07,996
Did you say that, Mr. Walsh?

473
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,084
The game is tentatively
scheduled forJanuary 16.

474
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,796
<i>- Hey, this is it!
- Sounds like fun, Barry, but evidently not for everyone.</i>

475
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,839
<i>No, I don't think so, Steve.
No one thought...</i>

476
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,050
to check with the New York Ranger
players about this.

477
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,385
<i>The bottom line is, you only get
a few days off during this long season.</i>

478
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,555
<i>Now, instead of spending these days off
at home with their families,</i>

479
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,724
they're told they gotta go to Alaska
and play a game of pond hockey.

480
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,894
<i>- This is a joke.
- Turning now to real hockey news,</i>

481
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,063
<i>the NHL named Wayne Gretzky
as its player of the month.</i>

482
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,691
<i>The superstar scored 17 goals
with 22 assists...</i>

483
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:48,658
Yeah, wait till we beat 'em.
Then we'll see who's a joke.

484
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,622
You guys know what you're made of.
You know what you've got inside.

485
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,919
Nervous?

486
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:07,425
- Come on, let's work it around.
- Don't leave him alone!

487
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:19,645
- Whoa. That guy can shoot, huh?
- Yeah.

488
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:23,232
- Get on him! Get on him!
- Okay, guys, come on, now!

489
00:39:33,408 --> 00:39:35,910
- Fighting the puck a little.
- Oh, let him find his legs.

490
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:37,953
Yeah, his first game.
He'll be fine.

491
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:47,754
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

492
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,884
Look out!

493
00:39:56,554 --> 00:39:58,472
<i>Get away! Get away!</i>

494
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,142
<i>- Stevie? Stevie!
- Give him some air.</i>

495
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,645
<i>- Biebe.
Good work, Tree. You killed him.</i>

496
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:08,023
- Head was down.
- I know. I know.

497
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:11,609
I brought the salts, Dad.

498
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:17,698
- Stevie?
- Huh?

499
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,784
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Hello.

500
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:25,956
Stevie, how many fingers
have I got? Hmm?

501
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,458
I'm a premature ejaculator.

502
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:36,465
<i>Let's go, guys.
Three on three.</i>

503
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,552
- So?
- So?

504
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,264
- Anyone special in New York?
- Uh, no.

505
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:47,309
I don't... I don't want you
to feel bad about that either,

506
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:50,061
just 'cause I haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than six weeks...

507
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,480
since we broke up
in the 12th grade.

508
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:54,774
- That's... The important thing is that you're happy.
- Right.

509
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:58,402
You are...
You are happy, I take it?

510
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:01,280
Yeah.
I'm happy.

511
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:03,532
Good. Good.

512
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:06,159
How is your husband,
anyway?

513
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:08,703
Appears to be, uh,
well fed.

514
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,872
Of course he is.

515
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:13,499
I mean, what else
do I have to do, really,

516
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:18,295
besides slave over a hot stove,
rub my fat husband's feet,

517
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:22,633
dig splinters out of my ass that I get
while sitting around pining for you?

518
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:26,053
Well, you said it,
I didn't.

519
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:28,221
Seriously, though.
I mean, forget about me.

520
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:30,807
Don't you ever wish you lived
in a town that had a museum...

521
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:36,395
or someplace where brothers and sisters
were off-limits to each other sexually?

522
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,199
All right,
just follow the light.

523
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:52,744
No, just over here. There you go.
Over here. Come on.

524
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:54,996
<i>Still sleepin'?</i>

525
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,873
- How's he doin'?
- He's a little happy.

526
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,251
<i>No, no, no.
Easy, son.</i>

527
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:04,838
<i>- I'm okay. Birdie, I'm sorry.
- All right.</i>

528
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,798
I didn't even get
the condom on.

529
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:10,510
It was 'cause of your sister's breasts.
They're perky.

530
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:18,601
Well, he's out again.

531
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,359
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

532
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,989
- Sweetheart...
- I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

533
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:36,534
Well, if you can't talk
to your own mother...

534
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:42,456
Stevie doesn't wanna
sleep with me.

535
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,460
Oh. Oh.

536
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:49,713
Oh.

537
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,423
<i>Hmm.</i>

538
00:42:52,548 --> 00:42:55,218
So, uh, you two
have already,

539
00:42:55,343 --> 00:42:59,138
uh, you know,
had relations?

540
00:42:59,263 --> 00:43:01,598
No, he came in the condom.

541
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,851
<i>Oh!</i>

542
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:06,269
Where, uh,
was the condom...

543
00:43:06,436 --> 00:43:09,773
when he, uh,
you know...

544
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:11,733
<i>Um...</i>

545
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,278
On-On his, uh, serpent.

546
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,741
Hi.

547
00:43:22,951 --> 00:43:24,911
What's wrong?

548
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:28,248
Uh, Walter, get out.
This is private.

549
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:30,625
I'm entitled to know
what's going on under this roof.

550
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,543
After all, I am
the father of this child.

551
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,755
Walter, if you don't leave,
I swear I'll tell you.

552
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,383
Right.

553
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:55,565
<i>The defendant will please rise.</i>

554
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,484
What say you, Karen?

555
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:01,570
The State of Alaska
versus Connor Banks.

556
00:44:01,695 --> 00:44:03,614
<i>Second-degree assault.</i>

557
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:08,201
<i>We find the defendant
not guilty.</i>

558
00:44:12,872 --> 00:44:15,958
That's a not guilty verdict on Connor.
Betty?

559
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:20,963
And we further order Price World
to pay damages...

560
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,048
in the amount of $42,000.

561
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:27,177
- What?
- 42,000 bucks?

562
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:30,221
They can't do that.

563
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:35,726
This is a criminal trial.

564
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:39,355
We don't award damages
to criminal defendants.

565
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:41,690
The damage award is vacated.

566
00:44:41,774 --> 00:44:44,901
What's that, "vacated"?

567
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:55,119
Look around.
Look at yourselves.

568
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:00,416
<i>You have exalted this game
above what is right,</i>

569
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,709
but you have
your star center back.

570
00:45:04,544 --> 00:45:06,880
<i>The defendant is free to go.</i>

571
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:11,217
You have embarrassed
my courtroom.

572
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,605
Thanks a lot.

573
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:27,607
Fuckin' moron.

574
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:46,833
It's me that embarrasses you,
isn't it?

575
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:54,257
- Did I say that, Brian?
- I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

576
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:57,802
I'm sorry I don't feel like goin'
to college and getting some degree.

577
00:45:57,885 --> 00:46:01,013
<i>I'm sorry for only wanting to play hockey,
and I'm sorry that you never played...</i>

578
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,058
in the Saturday game, but I would think
there are bigger tragedies in life!

579
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:08,228
<i>Brian!</i>

580
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,323
Scotty. Hey.

581
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,784
I want you to meet
the folks from the network.

582
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,995
- That's Jonathan Slaven. Scott Pitcher.
- Hi.

583
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,457
- And, uh, this is Janice Pettibone.
- My nostrils just froze.

584
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:33,334
It's a pleasure to welcome
a famous TV personality.

585
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,128
- Uh, hi.
- Janice, see how everybody skates here?

586
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:38,631
- Yeah.
- Even on the sidewalks. We should get some shots...

587
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:41,842
- I can't feel my nose.
- All right, then.

588
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:47,889
- She's cold.
- She's weird.

589
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,060
"Eskimos On Ice. "

590
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:55,188
In fact, that's what we're calling
the team: The Mystery Eskimos.

591
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,108
Well, we're not Eskimos.

592
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,735
Well, I don't think it refers
so much to your ethnicity.

593
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:06,573
And the Native Americans who do live
here call themselves Inuit, shark meat.

594
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,117
<i>The deal here is we're selling
this as a human interest story.</i>

595
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,829
The strange snowmen who play
on a lake... the Mystery boys.

596
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:15,373
<i>We don't know who they are
or what they are.</i>

597
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:19,668
All we know is they have poor dental
health and can skate like the wind.

598
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,589
It's a hockey game.

599
00:47:23,755 --> 00:47:26,341
- How does she know what kind of dental health we have?
- Guys!

600
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:29,094
Guys!
It's just a name, you know?

601
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,888
Nobody thinks the Dallas Cowboys
are actually cowboys.

602
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:33,848
- If this ends up making fun of us...
- Scott, it won't.

603
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:37,143
<i>- You think I'd let that happen?
- For business, who knows?</i>

604
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:39,103
- Excuse me?
- He's right.

605
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:41,105
- You'd bite off your own jimmy if the price were right.
- Really, Scott?

606
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:43,982
My own jimmy? You know what?
Why don't you go plan a rummage sale...

607
00:47:44,024 --> 00:47:46,485
- or renew a fishing licence?
- If you try pulling something, I'll be so far up your ass...

608
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:50,155
- Gentlemen.
- You sorry piece of tit meat!

609
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,537
- Just talkin' about the game.
- Yeah.

610
00:47:58,662 --> 00:48:01,332
If nothing else,
it's good for morale.

611
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:07,254
Good night.

612
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:10,590
No blood.
Judge!

613
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:13,217
- He started it.
- Don't!

614
00:48:13,343 --> 00:48:15,678
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

615
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,805
I don't know how to coach.

616
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:21,266
You taught half the kids in this town
how to skate. You played 2-A college.

617
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:23,936
You understand
North American hockey.

618
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:27,230
Shit, they used to call you
the Bear.

619
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:29,482
That was then.

620
00:48:31,734 --> 00:48:33,820
Okay, Judge.

621
00:48:33,903 --> 00:48:36,781
If we're gonna make a game of it,
it should be you.

622
00:48:36,906 --> 00:48:39,700
It won't be, John.

623
00:48:43,704 --> 00:48:45,706
Come on! Pull it off!

624
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:49,334
People of Mystery,
I give you...

625
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,879
your very own Zamboni.

626
00:48:53,004 --> 00:48:56,841
<i>- Now, don't be alarmed.
- It looks 100 years old.</i>

627
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:59,135
<i>Well, it works just like new,</i>

628
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,513
and it's kind of in keeping with
the whole idea, don't you think?

629
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:04,723
What whole idea?

630
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:08,518
Scott, you got a Zamboni here
in Mystery, Alaska.

631
00:49:08,685 --> 00:49:11,938
Yeah.
The original.

632
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:39,421
Why'd you say yes to boards?
Sponsors?

633
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,676
You guys have never played with boards.
Won't that be a huge advantage to the Rangers?

634
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:52,016
John?

635
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,936
You've been smiling
a lot lately.

636
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,688
<i>- Excuse me?
- Ever since he came back.</i>

637
00:49:57,855 --> 00:50:02,526
Charlie.
You've been smiling a little more.

638
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:06,571
John, that was high school.

639
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:14,745
This is not a pond.

640
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,710
<i>The fans are into it.</i>

641
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:23,712
Let's play hockey.

642
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:26,256
- Oh, there we go.
- Oh, Domi and Langdon.

643
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:31,344
Well, eight seconds in. Domi leads
the league in penalty minutes.

644
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:34,972
<i>A couple of short rights knocks the helmet
off. Another one. Are they gonna get tired?</i>

645
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:37,808
<i>- I don't know.
- We're playing these guys?</i>

646
00:50:37,892 --> 00:50:40,227
Oh, he's landing a couple of big ones,
and so is Domi.

647
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:42,479
He's got the fans
into this one early, Sam.

648
00:50:42,563 --> 00:50:44,731
Yo, maybe we should fast-forward
to the hockey part.

649
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:47,275
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

650
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:49,694
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

651
00:50:52,405 --> 00:50:55,241
- Come on.

652
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:58,411
<i>- Come on!</i>

653
00:50:58,536 --> 00:51:02,081
- Caboose, holding on back there?
- Yeah.

654
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:04,374
<i>- Toot, toot!
- Uh-oh! Uh-oh, we're gonna crash!</i>

655
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,501
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

656
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:08,878
<i>- What happened down here?</i>

657
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:11,589
Are you okay? Let me see.
Are you all right?

658
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:17,094
It's a Rockewellian Christmas
up here...

659
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:19,597
<i>skating, barbecues, snow.</i>

660
00:51:19,763 --> 00:51:22,516
<i>We're here with defenseman
Matt Marden and...</i>

661
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,726
<i>- Cut.
- What?</i>

662
00:51:24,893 --> 00:51:27,646
<i>I can't feel my fingers.</i>

663
00:51:27,729 --> 00:51:31,149
You need to rub 'em on
a nice warm Yuletide log.

664
00:51:34,277 --> 00:51:36,612
I beg your pardon?

665
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:41,241
Look. Christmas is a lonely day
for a guy to be choking his own chicken.

666
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:45,579
And, as women reporters go,
I find you supple.

667
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:50,708
Oh, that was lovely. It's a shame
we weren't rolling for that.

668
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,252
I'm sure he'd be happy
to repeat it.

669
00:51:54,754 --> 00:51:56,839
- You need to relax.
- Charles!

670
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:58,799
Do you like massages?

671
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,271
- Tree, take the man up front!
- Defense!

672
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:15,523
Tree, you've got to take
the man!

673
00:52:15,648 --> 00:52:18,234
<i>- Jesus!
- All right, all right, all right, all right.</i>

674
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:20,361
Sorry, Johnny.

675
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:24,781
- Don't say you're sorry.
- Okay.

676
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:26,950
Sorry.

677
00:52:27,075 --> 00:52:28,910
Tree, am I a big guy?

678
00:52:30,078 --> 00:52:32,580
Yeah, Johnny.

679
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,752
No. Look.

680
00:52:37,918 --> 00:52:40,212
See? You're the big guy.

681
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:44,258
And we need you to start
playing like a big guy.

682
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:47,302
Okay?
Are you a big guy?

683
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:50,013
- Yes, Johnny.
- Come on. Say it.

684
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:51,973
Say it!

685
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:56,644
- I'm a big guy!
- Okay!

686
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:59,021
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

687
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:00,981
Okay, hit me.

688
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:03,817
I don't want
to hit you, Johnny.

689
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:06,987
- Come on, Tree. Hit me!
- Johnny...

690
00:53:07,112 --> 00:53:10,031
I'm notJohnny!
I'm a New York Ranger!

691
00:53:10,156 --> 00:53:12,825
- Hit me!
- Stop it!

692
00:53:12,992 --> 00:53:14,994
You look like the back end
of a moose, Sasquatch.

693
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:21,750
<i>You all right?</i>

694
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,752
Just like that, Tree.

695
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:27,130
<i>- You hit me like that,
I'll kick your ass.</i>

696
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:29,049
<i>Eskimo soup.</i>

697
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:32,594
I'm beginning to have
second thoughts about this.

698
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:36,222
And having Chuck Fuck as our liaison
with the network doesn't help.

699
00:53:36,305 --> 00:53:38,182
If they're gonna be pouring
a lot of money into it,

700
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:41,435
I suppose you have to let them sell it.
I suppose.

701
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,645
Besides, if they're going to
be doing a profile on the town,

702
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:45,564
it's as good
as a commercial.

703
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,732
<i>Our tourism might grow.</i>

704
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:50,193
You know, this is the kind
of opportunity that...

705
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:52,153
What?

706
00:53:56,324 --> 00:53:58,617
What's that?

707
00:53:58,784 --> 00:54:01,829
Skank Marden's
been in this bed.

708
00:54:29,938 --> 00:54:31,814
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

709
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,733
Well, that's just great.

710
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,818
Shit!

711
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:43,408
- What?
- Uh, we got a problem.

712
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:46,953
- What problem?
- Uh...

713
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,664
They're not coming.

714
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,126
What do you mean,
not coming?

715
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:55,127
Evidently,
the Ranger players...

716
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:58,547
filed some kind of grievance
with the players' union,

717
00:54:58,714 --> 00:55:02,759
<i>- and, uh...
- We tapped ourselves on the construction.</i>

718
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:07,180
- Are you saying that we're not
going to get that money now?

719
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:11,142
Uh, I don't think so, no.

720
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:18,107
I'm really sorry, Scott.
I don't... I don't even...

721
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:23,570
<i>Jesus Christ, Scott!
Ow!</i>

722
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,281
Jesus! Oh, man!

723
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:37,541
Hey, hey.
That's enough.

724
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:39,793
It's keeping the kids awake.
Come on.

725
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:43,589
I should arrest him.
That's what I should do.

726
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:46,758
Arrest him for what?

727
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:48,760
Fraud.

728
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,353
Hey, he promised something
that he couldn't deliver.

729
00:55:59,478 --> 00:56:01,355
This town spent money,

730
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:03,315
relying on
Charlie Danner's word.

731
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:05,400
Flying in here
on a helicopter,

732
00:56:05,484 --> 00:56:07,319
- swinging the New York Rangers from his belt.
- Come on, John.

733
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:09,362
- You can't blame Charlie for that.
- Who else is there to blame?

734
00:56:09,487 --> 00:56:11,614
You want to sympathize
with the guy, fine.

735
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:14,033
<i>But I really do not
need you taking his side.</i>

736
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:18,079
- Okay. What is going on?
- You tell me.

737
00:56:18,162 --> 00:56:20,080
Okay, I think I've been pretty patient
with this little jealousy thing.

738
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:23,333
The truth is, I've been a little bit
flattered. Now I'm getting insulted.

739
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,794
<i>- You're insulted?
- Yes, John.</i>

740
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:28,755
When you read my smiling at him
as a threat, that insults me.

741
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:37,346
It is not just
a random smile, Donna.

742
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:40,933
Ever since he came back...

743
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:43,185
you've been walking around with
a big "what if" on your face.

744
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,687
We've been married 12 years.
Three kids.

745
00:56:45,812 --> 00:56:48,106
Sweetheart,
I know your smiles.

746
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:51,401
And that smile is not for me.

747
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:56,405
John, everyone in this goddamn town
peeks over the snowbank and wonders.

748
00:56:56,572 --> 00:56:58,741
Except you wonder what
it would be like with him...

749
00:56:58,908 --> 00:57:00,743
Charlie fuckin' Danner!

750
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:08,375
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

751
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:12,086
You became half dead the minute you were
bumped from that team. You disappeared.

752
00:57:12,253 --> 00:57:16,882
<i>This is not an easy place
for a woman, John.</i>

753
00:57:17,049 --> 00:57:19,969
I thank God every day
I gave birth to boys.

754
00:57:23,263 --> 00:57:27,726
I never chose to stay.
I chose you.

755
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:30,186
<i>Give me that,
at least.</i>

756
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:49,329
Move that puck, fellas!
He's opening up!

757
00:57:49,371 --> 00:57:52,040
Move that puck, fellas!
He's opening up!

758
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,833
Pass it out
to the wing!

759
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:57,336
<i>Pass the puck! Pass that puck!
That a boy!</i>

760
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,006
Over here!
Whoo!

761
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:04,718
<i>Hi.</i>

762
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:08,346
<i>Young man,
lift your elbows.</i>

763
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:11,391
<i>And that'll keep the blade
flat on the ice.</i>

764
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:13,351
I mean, you paid
for the whole stick.

765
00:58:13,518 --> 00:58:15,436
You might as well use it all, huh?
Try it.

766
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,396
<i>- Good! Good, McGowan!
- Good.</i>

767
00:58:21,066 --> 00:58:23,819
Hey. I'm goin' on a piss later.
You wanna join me?

768
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:27,739
No.

769
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:30,325
The league is taking
the players' union...

770
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,494
to federal court
in New York on Tuesday.

771
00:58:33,703 --> 00:58:36,414
It might help if Mystery
had a face there.

772
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:40,209
There's an estoppel argument
you could make.

773
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:43,003
Implied third-party contract too.

774
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,213
Hmm.

775
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:23,582
Well, now we really have something
to talk about, don't we?

776
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:27,878
You slept with another man.

777
00:59:28,003 --> 00:59:30,630
What's to talk about,
MaryJane?

778
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,727
All I've got...

779
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:50,523
is the notion that being
adored by your husband...

780
00:59:50,648 --> 00:59:53,067
is enough in life.

781
00:59:56,279 --> 00:59:58,155
<i>You never touch me.</i>

782
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:18,632
Go ahead.

783
01:00:26,598 --> 01:00:29,809
<i>Nothing in the basic agreement
allows them...</i>

784
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:31,769
to schedule
exhibition games.

785
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,814
- Of course we can schedule exhibition
games. - Pre-season exhibition, but...

786
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:39,568
Your Honor, nothing has ever limited
this to pre-season. You know this, Harold.

787
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:42,780
<i>It's a cheap stunt,
Your Honor, and everybody knows that.</i>

788
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:47,576
<i>They want the Ranger players to go up to
the North Pole and play pond hockey...</i>

789
01:00:47,742 --> 01:00:49,619
with a bunch of Eskimos.

790
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:53,122
It's a big gimmick.
I mean, Mr. Pruitt himself...

791
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:56,542
has brought one of his
lumberjack players with him...

792
01:00:56,709 --> 01:00:58,627
<i>to help him further
the exploitation.</i>

793
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:00,546
Objection, Your Honor.

794
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:03,715
That's-That's not
a very nice thing to say.

795
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:09,137
Your Honor, we've already
spent a lot of money on this game.

796
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:11,931
You can sue the league
for restitution.

797
01:01:12,056 --> 01:01:14,517
That's assuming that money
damages could make us whole.

798
01:01:14,642 --> 01:01:17,186
But our reputation
has been hurt.

799
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:20,689
Reputation? Price World tried
to move up there, you opened fire.

800
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:22,608
What reputation?

801
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:27,028
- Could I be heard?
- Go ahead.

802
01:01:34,243 --> 01:01:36,912
We do have our pride.

803
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:38,914
And...

804
01:01:44,628 --> 01:01:49,924
And, uh, maybe sometimes it's a little
too connected to how well we play hockey,

805
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:52,510
but we do have our pride.

806
01:01:52,677 --> 01:01:56,514
And all of you,
and all the TV commentators...

807
01:01:56,681 --> 01:01:59,141
have been going around
saying that this is a farce...

808
01:01:59,308 --> 01:02:01,518
that this
is all a big joke.

809
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:04,563
Our town is a big joke.

810
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:06,648
- Is there a legal argument coming?
- It's estoppel.

811
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:08,942
It's-It's in my brief.

812
01:02:09,067 --> 01:02:11,694
What-What did you call...
You called my friend something before.

813
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:15,198
- What did you call him?
- A lumberjack.

814
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:19,910
<i>That boy has a heart bigger
than this whole courtroom.</i>

815
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:22,121
He plays to play.

816
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:24,915
He skates to skate!

817
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,334
He don't make
a million bucks a year!

818
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:30,336
He loves the game of hockey!

819
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:32,422
<i>He loves it.</i>

820
01:02:35,716 --> 01:02:37,510
Judge,

821
01:02:39,303 --> 01:02:41,972
you can't take this game
away from us.

822
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:45,058
You can't.
It's not about money.

823
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:47,102
It's about our...

824
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:50,855
Mr. Pruitt?
Are you all right?

825
01:02:53,191 --> 01:02:56,319
<i>- Bailey?
- Mr. Pruitt?</i>

826
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:04,534
<i>- Bailey? Bailey? Bailey?
Somebody get this man some help!</i>

827
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:08,580
He's having a heart attack!
Somebody help him!

828
01:03:08,883 --> 01:03:11,135
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- Bailiff, call 911.</i>

829
01:03:11,261 --> 01:03:13,221
<i>- Bailey!
- Give him some air!</i>

830
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:16,474
<i>Get somebody in here now!</i>

831
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:18,434
He's not breathing!

832
01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:23,105
Bailey! Bailey!

833
01:04:12,191 --> 01:04:14,068
My, uh...

834
01:04:16,988 --> 01:04:20,032
My boy Mike once asked Bailey
how he got to be so fat.

835
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:27,122
He said it was...

836
01:04:27,247 --> 01:04:29,666
because every time
he met somebody he liked,

837
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,669
his heart would grow
a little.

838
01:04:35,296 --> 01:04:37,089
There were just so many
good people in Mystery...

839
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:40,092
that eventually his body
had to expand to accommodate.

840
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:49,976
He could have left if he wanted,
but he stayed.

841
01:04:50,101 --> 01:04:52,937
<i>Not because other worlds
weren't available to him.</i>

842
01:04:54,564 --> 01:04:56,315
<i>Because he loved
this place.</i>

843
01:04:59,777 --> 01:05:02,070
"This is a hockey town,"
he'd say.

844
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:09,619
And he never said it like it was
something we should have to apologize for.

845
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,045
We're a hockey town.

846
01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:48,029
I love this town, too, John.

847
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,264
You sent him,
didn't you?

848
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,225
To New York.

849
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,942
He won.

850
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:40,035
Game's back on?

851
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:43,288
You're in this now,
old bear.

852
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:45,957
You have to coach.

853
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:53,089
If I'm coaching,

854
01:06:53,172 --> 01:06:56,842
I need a captain
on the ice.

855
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:11,231
Move it!

856
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:15,735
<i>Move it, Stevie!</i>

857
01:07:15,902 --> 01:07:19,697
<i>Come on, Birdie!</i>

858
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:23,825
<i>Move it!</i>

859
01:07:29,372 --> 01:07:32,208
<i>- Move it, Birdie!
- I'm moving!</i>

860
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,252
<i>Let's go, guys! Let's do this!</i>

861
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:36,504
Pick up your feet!

862
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:38,672
<i>Push over!</i>

863
01:07:46,388 --> 01:07:48,848
Oh, man, I'm dying.

864
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:50,850
You lose a puck
over there in the bank,

865
01:07:51,017 --> 01:07:53,144
you give it
to the other team.

866
01:07:53,227 --> 01:07:55,438
If you lose a puck...

867
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,357
along the boards,
you gotta fight for it!

868
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,317
Do you understand me?

869
01:08:00,442 --> 01:08:02,361
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!</i>

870
01:08:07,657 --> 01:08:10,660
<i>Come on, you guys!
Pick 'em up!</i>

871
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:13,287
Whoo!

872
01:08:24,214 --> 01:08:26,424
<i>So, who are you gonna get?</i>

873
01:08:26,633 --> 01:08:28,677
Oh, some celebrity.

874
01:08:28,802 --> 01:08:30,887
- To sing the National Anthem?
- Uh-huh.

875
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:33,639
<i>That's great.</i>

876
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:35,641
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.

877
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,979
<i>Coming!</i>

878
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:45,734
Don't worry.
I didn't come here to sleep with you.

879
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:48,528
I came to see your husband.

880
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:56,494
Can I talk to you
for a second?

881
01:09:05,085 --> 01:09:07,045
Uh...

882
01:09:08,129 --> 01:09:10,423
I, uh,

883
01:09:10,548 --> 01:09:13,217
I just wanted to say,

884
01:09:13,384 --> 01:09:16,929
you know,
that I'm sorry.

885
01:09:17,054 --> 01:09:22,351
Uh, the truth is,
I don't really think about anything.

886
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,853
I play hockey
and I fornicate...

887
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:28,398
because they're the two
most fun things in cold weather.

888
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:31,025
And...

889
01:09:31,192 --> 01:09:32,985
when I get too old
to play in the game,

890
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:35,404
I'll probably just end up a drunk,
like my dad.

891
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,116
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

892
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,664
And, uh,

893
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:48,166
I know that your
being mayor and all,

894
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:53,129
this game is a real
positive reflection on you.

895
01:09:54,922 --> 01:09:59,260
Anyway, I'm gonna do everything
I can to win this game...

896
01:09:59,385 --> 01:10:01,261
for Mystery,

897
01:10:01,428 --> 01:10:03,847
for dead Bailey,

898
01:10:03,972 --> 01:10:05,974
for you.

899
01:10:08,184 --> 01:10:10,103
That's all
I came to say.

900
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:42,591
- Oh, my God!
- Is the whole team in there?

901
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:19,416
- How are you? Welcome to Mystery.
- Oh, my God!

902
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:26,256
- Steroids?
- Yeah.

903
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:32,220
- Big. -
Uh-huh. - Yeah.

904
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:35,640
Not that big.

905
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:40,853
- Go for it!
- Hey, what's your name?

906
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:43,063
- Make it out to Stevie.
- Stevie.

907
01:11:44,314 --> 01:11:46,149
- Here you go, Stevie.
- Wow.

908
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,403
Uh, a little problem,
Johnny.

909
01:12:04,207 --> 01:12:07,794
- Aah!

910
01:12:36,237 --> 01:12:40,115
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I'm leaving town.

911
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,826
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Get down.

912
01:12:44,786 --> 01:12:49,499
Why? It's my Zamboni, right?
I brought it here.

913
01:12:49,624 --> 01:12:54,045
- You want me to take you in?
- What, are you gonna arrest me for reckless Zamboni dri...

914
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,797
Fine. Take me in, John.
I don't care.

915
01:12:56,964 --> 01:13:00,009
Why don't you impound
my helicopter?

916
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:04,471
Whoa. Why don't you break
my goddamn nose too, huh?

917
01:13:04,596 --> 01:13:07,474
They'd probably elect you mayor.

918
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:12,270
- You wanna get some coffee?
- L... Where's my parade? Huh?

919
01:13:12,395 --> 01:13:15,273
<i>I brought 'em here.
Why don't I get a parade?</i>

920
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:18,776
You know what I'd settle for
is a thank you.

921
01:13:18,817 --> 01:13:21,111
This fuckin' town.

922
01:13:22,613 --> 01:13:26,324
You know, when I left,
this town rejected me.

923
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:28,285
<i>Huh?</i>

924
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:30,829
The day I checked out of here,
all I could think about...

925
01:13:30,954 --> 01:13:33,790
was the day I would chug back in
with a Pulitzer in my hand.

926
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:35,708
<i>And I would step off
that train and say,</i>

927
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,835
"Why don't you
skate on this, you... "

928
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,505
I'm sick.
Oh, God, I'm sick. Oh, God.

929
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:51,848
So that's what this
is all about, Charlie?

930
01:13:51,973 --> 01:13:54,016
You saying fuck you
to all of us?

931
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:56,018
No, it's not.

932
01:13:56,143 --> 01:13:59,230
Goddamn, John,
what do I gotta do?

933
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:02,399
Huh? This town is hockey,
hockey, hockey, right?

934
01:14:02,524 --> 01:14:04,526
So I bring back
the New York Rangers.

935
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:08,029
<i>- The New York Rangers!
- You don't get it, do you?</i>

936
01:14:08,154 --> 01:14:10,532
Oh, I...
Clearly not.

937
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:14,410
Well, leaving out the fact that you
set all this up for your own benefit,

938
01:14:14,577 --> 01:14:17,246
<i>we agreed to a game
of pond hockey,</i>

939
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:19,206
on open ice.

940
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:21,250
Now we're playing on a rink
in a box...

941
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:24,252
boards, blue lines,
referees.

942
01:14:24,378 --> 01:14:26,713
What if we lose this game
25-zip, Charlie?

943
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,840
<i>You brought back
the one thing...</i>

944
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,134
<i>that could tear the heart
out of this place.</i>

945
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:35,846
Now, either you
thought about that,

946
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,765
or you didn't.

947
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:55,156
- Finally got them down.
- Uh-huh.

948
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:18,677
<i>Dear Abby.</i>

949
01:15:20,346 --> 01:15:22,931
All the words
are crossed out.

950
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:26,518
Not the important ones.

951
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:34,400
Just read it.

952
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:40,656

Simple.

<i>John?</i>

01:17:58,365 --> 01:18:00,492
Hey!

970
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:03,787
<i>Yeah.
Heard you lost a little.</i>

971
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,419
Ah! Whoo!
You can't catch me!

972
01:18:14,714 --> 01:18:16,716
Okay. All right.
Okay.

973
01:18:29,144 --> 01:18:31,062
Hmm.

974
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,967
Mmm!

975
01:19:30,575 --> 01:19:34,328
Inuit, Eskimo... whatever.
Just zero in on faces that look local.

976
01:19:34,495 --> 01:19:36,330
<i>Okay, ready, five?
Take five.</i>

977
01:19:36,497 --> 01:19:38,249
<i>Welcome back.
I'm Jim Fox.</i>

978
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,209
And joining me right now is
hockey legend Donnie Shulzhoffer...

979
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:42,252
in from Flin Flon,
Manitoba.

980
01:19:42,336 --> 01:19:44,171
Donnie,
let's get right to it.

981
01:19:44,338 --> 01:19:46,381
I've had a chance to see the
Mystery team practice. They skate fast,

982
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:48,675
and a couple of guys
can really shoot the puck.

983
01:19:48,758 --> 01:19:52,595
Look, the Alaskans have never taken on a
team of this size and skill before, okay?

984
01:19:52,762 --> 01:19:56,932
And don't kid yourself. The New York
Rangers are taking this game personal.

985
01:19:57,099 --> 01:20:00,019
<i>All right?
It isn't exactly rocket surgery.</i>

986
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:01,979
Now send the kids
out of the room.

987
01:20:02,104 --> 01:20:04,773
I don't care how fast a skater you are,
if you don't play this game...

988
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,025
with a big heart and a big
bag of knuckles...

989
01:20:07,192 --> 01:20:10,195
in front of the net,
you don't got dinky-do.

990
01:20:39,013 --> 01:20:41,849
- He'll see you now.
- Oh!

991
01:20:43,016 --> 01:20:44,810
Oh, wow.

992
01:20:44,976 --> 01:20:48,188
Uh, th...
Thank you for seeing me, Mister...

993
01:20:48,313 --> 01:20:50,190
Little Richard.

994
01:20:50,356 --> 01:20:52,233
This is an honor.

995
01:20:52,358 --> 01:20:54,861
May I?

996
01:21:01,366 --> 01:21:04,453
Little Richard,
I'm from Mystery.

997
01:21:04,536 --> 01:21:06,413
Now, this is a little town
that derives...

998
01:21:06,538 --> 01:21:09,165
much of its esteem
from hockey.

999
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:11,251
<i>I was wondering.</i>

1000
01:21:11,376 --> 01:21:15,588
When you're singing
the National Anthem...

1001
01:21:15,713 --> 01:21:18,757
<i>- Well...
- I'm cold.</i>

1002
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,009
Yes.

1003
01:21:21,135 --> 01:21:23,387
Which makes what I'm
about to ask...

1004
01:21:23,553 --> 01:21:26,056
seem like
a monumental request.

1005
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:29,434
- Can I get one?
- Okay, everybody, get your newspapers here.

1006
01:21:29,559 --> 01:21:33,187
- One newspaper apiece. Hi.
- Enjoy the game.

1007
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,982
Hello. I'm Doug McLeod,
and with me is NHL Hall of Famer...

1008
01:21:36,148 --> 01:21:39,485
and two-time Stanley Cup winner,
Phil Esposito.

1009
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:41,612
<i>It's the Great Alaskan
Hockey Rush...</i>

1010
01:21:41,737 --> 01:21:44,197
<i>brought to you live
by the National Hockey League...</i>

1011
01:21:44,323 --> 01:21:46,408
<i>and the Sports Broadcasting
Corporation,</i>

1012
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:49,077
<i>pitting the New York Rangers...</i>

1013
01:21:49,202 --> 01:21:54,040
<i>against a Cinderella team from
the tiny town of Mystery, Alaska.</i>

1014
01:21:54,207 --> 01:21:56,083
And here come
the red, white and blue.

1015
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:12,015
- Look at this! Wow. No respect. I love it.

1016
01:22:26,653 --> 01:22:28,697
And here come
the boys of winter.

1017
01:22:35,786 --> 01:22:37,872
All right!

1018
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:44,378
<i>Well, there are
only 11 skaters to the Rangers' 18,</i>

1019
01:22:44,544 --> 01:22:46,338
<i>but also,
it's minus ten outside.</i>

1020
01:22:46,463 --> 01:22:48,673
<i>That kind of cold
can be rough on the New Yorkers.</i>

1021
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,176
<i>There's no doubt about it. But Mystery's
going to need more than the cold on their side.</i>

1022
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:55,221
<i>- Yeah, Stevie!
- The town's grocer is their best scorer,</i>

1023
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:57,723
<i>their fastest guy
is a high school kid...</i>

1024
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,808
<i>and the captain
is the town sheriff.</i>

1025
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:03,103
<i>Like we said,
folks, this is a small town.</i>

1026
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:07,148
And the size of this ice surface could
be an equalizer for the Mystery team.

1027
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:09,776
- It'll definitely help.
I've never seen ice this big.

1028
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,070
<i>It's even bigger
than the Olympic rinks.</i>

1029
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:15,364
<i>And now,
to sing the National Anthem, the one,</i>

1030
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:18,450
<i>the only,
Little Richard!</i>

1031
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:29,586
<i>"Tutti Frutti"!</i>

1032
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:32,171
This is great, huh?

1033
01:23:57,903 --> 01:23:59,822
Camera three, stay off the Rangers.
They look miserable.

1034
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:03,659
They're freezing already. Why the hell
is he singing so goddamn slow?

1035
01:24:16,545 --> 01:24:20,174
- Yeah!

1036
01:24:22,426 --> 01:24:25,804
- Wow! Maybe the cold slowed him down.
- Beautiful.

1037
01:24:25,929 --> 01:24:28,807
<i>- All right, the starting lineups...</i>

1038
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:31,851
- Uh-oh. - Great!

1039
01:24:31,935 --> 01:24:33,895
Starting to piss me off.

1040
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:36,439
Where does it say
Canadian National Anthem?

1041
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:44,571
- You all right?

1042
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:48,575
The Mystery team
has a shot, right?

1043
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,827
- A shot at what?

1044
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,831
Hey, listen, buddy.

1045
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:58,584
Do you know where a guy can get
a rub and a tug around here?

1046
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:02,087
What?

1047
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:04,923
<i>Here we go. Let's play hockey.</i>

1048
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:07,175
All the hoopla is over.

1049
01:25:07,259 --> 01:25:09,177
The puck drops here.

1050
01:25:18,185 --> 01:25:21,688
<i>Jackson dumps Banks and gets the draw.</i>

1051
01:25:21,855 --> 01:25:24,816
<i>Back to Billy Wasson.
He moves up and gives back toJackson.</i>

1052
01:25:24,941 --> 01:25:27,193
<i>He takes it wide
and gains the Mystery zone.</i>

1053
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,779
<i>Down the borders with Lane
checkingJackson around the net.</i>

1054
01:25:29,946 --> 01:25:33,199
<i>Back to Wasson, wide open.
Shoots... What a save by Holt!</i>

1055
01:25:33,324 --> 01:25:35,993
<i>Get it out, guys!
Get it out!</i>

1056
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:38,704
<i>Mystery is rattled. They're
running around like a house league.</i>

1057
01:25:38,871 --> 01:25:41,874
- Don't chase! Don't chase!
- Get it!

1058
01:25:43,584 --> 01:25:46,378
<i>Jackson controls again.
Over to King.</i>

1059
01:25:46,503 --> 01:25:49,047
<i>He moves it to Wasson,
over to Robertson.</i>

1060
01:25:49,172 --> 01:25:51,841
<i>Nifty toe drag around Banks.
Shoots! And a save by Holt.</i>

1061
01:25:51,924 --> 01:25:55,094
<i>- Shit.
- Rangers in control. Holt with another save!</i>

1062
01:25:55,261 --> 01:25:57,138
<i>It's a shooting gallery out there!</i>

1063
01:25:57,263 --> 01:26:00,349
<i>Wasson, a shot. Jackson shooting.</i>

1064
01:26:00,516 --> 01:26:02,392
<i>Finally, Holt controls
the rebound.</i>

1065
01:26:02,559 --> 01:26:04,770
<i>He dishes it around
behind the net forJohn Biebe.</i>

1066
01:26:04,895 --> 01:26:07,188
<i>Take your time! Take your time!
- And the captain holds it there.</i>

1067
01:26:07,355 --> 01:26:09,524
<i>Rangers press
as Mystery breaks out.</i>

1068
01:26:09,607 --> 01:26:11,317
<i>- Biebe on over to Banks in the corner.
- Go to Connor!</i>

1069
01:26:11,484 --> 01:26:14,028
<i>And there's the pass.</i>

1070
01:26:14,153 --> 01:26:16,655
<i>Here comes Weeks.
He is behind the advance.</i>

1071
01:26:16,822 --> 01:26:18,866
<i>It is one on one
with Sam Gainer.</i>

1072
01:26:18,991 --> 01:26:21,618
<i>It is a two-man hockey game
right here!</i>

1073
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,538
<i>He leads left, goes right,
shoots... Scores!</i>

1074
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:30,210
<i>Weeks scores on the breakaway,
and Mystery leads, one to nothing.</i>

1075
01:26:30,376 --> 01:26:32,962
<i>- That's cool!
- Unbelievable.</i>

1076
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,923
One step and he was gone.

1077
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,842
That kid can actually fly.

1078
01:26:37,883 --> 01:26:39,802
<i>Two minutes
into the first period,</i>

1079
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,762
<i>Mystery gets
on the board first,</i>

1080
01:26:41,887 --> 01:26:44,723
<i>- and this home crowd is going crazy.
- Whoo!</i>

1081
01:26:52,105 --> 01:26:53,981
<i>Here we go at center ice.</i>

1082
01:26:54,106 --> 01:26:57,443
<i>Rangers win again.
Duffin chased into the Mystery zone.</i>

1083
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:00,863
<i>Biebe back to get it.
Neskorami on the porch.</i>

1084
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,073
<i>And hard! He stamps the captain
into the screen!</i>

1085
01:27:03,156 --> 01:27:05,575
High sticking, fuck shit!

1086
01:27:05,742 --> 01:27:08,495
<i>- No!
- So much for a friendly exhibition game.</i>

1087
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:11,706
<i>- Play the man!
- Mystery has settled a bit,</i>

1088
01:27:11,831 --> 01:27:14,500
<i>but the Rangers
continue to control.</i>

1089
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:16,711
<i>This is Ranger hockey.</i>

1090
01:27:16,836 --> 01:27:19,922
<i>Wasson's back for a shot...
and Winetka steals!</i>

1091
01:27:20,089 --> 01:27:23,300
<i>Here comes the odd-man rush.
It is Ben and Galin.</i>

1092
01:27:23,467 --> 01:27:26,094
<i>Look at the passing here!</i>

1093
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:28,930
<i>Connolly trailing. Drop, pass, shot.</i>

1094
01:27:29,055 --> 01:27:31,975
<i>- Saved by Gainer!
- Shit!</i>

1095
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,394
<i>He moves it around to Yeaton.
Swings a pass on the take to Lovulette.</i>

1096
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,607
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, yes, indeed!</i>

1097
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:43,819
<i>- Great hit.
- Did you see that? That's my Tree!</i>

1098
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:47,739
<i>- And some Rangers
take exception to that hit.</i>

1099
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:50,033
Okay, that's it!
You're gone!

1100
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:52,744
<i>Outta here. Get out.</i>

1101
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,538
Hey, that one is too small, eh?

1102
01:27:55,663 --> 01:27:57,540
Next time send me
a bigger one.

1103
01:27:57,706 --> 01:28:01,877
The biggest one you got.

1104
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,380
Knock it off.
That'll be enough.

1105
01:28:07,299 --> 01:28:09,717
<i>Come on, this is your puck!</i>

1106
01:28:09,843 --> 01:28:12,178
<i>Banks wins the draw.
Over to Marden, up toward Burns.</i>

1107
01:28:12,345 --> 01:28:14,847
<i>And here they come,
five on four!</i>

1108
01:28:15,014 --> 01:28:17,892
<i>Burns lays it
behind the net to Weeks.</i>

1109
01:28:18,058 --> 01:28:21,228
<i>Now Mystery sets off on the power play
in the Ranger zone.</i>

1110
01:28:21,353 --> 01:28:24,439
<i>They're looking to find Connor Banks.
He is the sniper.</i>

1111
01:28:24,606 --> 01:28:28,568
<i>Biebe. Banks.
One-timer! Scores!</i>

1112
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:30,695
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1113
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:34,991
<i>Connor Banks and a one-timer
from Biebe! Wow!</i>

1114
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,412
Great pass!
Great pass!

1115
01:28:42,456 --> 01:28:44,666
<i>And it's Mystery two
and the Rangers zero.</i>

1116
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:47,502
<i>This kid Connor
has got a shot like a bullet.</i>

1117
01:28:47,586 --> 01:28:50,046
I mean, he's a grocery clerk,
for crying out loud.

1118
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:51,965
The Rangers look stunned, Doug.

1119
01:28:52,173 --> 01:28:54,050
<i>We're bringing
them down, guys!</i>

1120
01:28:54,217 --> 01:28:56,093
Two-nothing.
Let's keep it up!

1121
01:28:56,218 --> 01:28:59,221
- Whoo!
- They act like lumberjacks!

1122
01:29:10,398 --> 01:29:13,234
Donnie, the Mystery boys... two
unanswered goals in the first period.

1123
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:16,821
Jimmy, you gotta love these kids.
God knows I do.

1124
01:29:16,904 --> 01:29:19,615
<i>What is going on?
Somebody lit a fire under their ass.</i>

1125
01:29:19,698 --> 01:29:21,700
<i>This is A-number one,
first-class hockey.</i>

1126
01:29:21,909 --> 01:29:23,785
You know I'm not a fan
of that tippy-tappy,

1127
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:26,204
tic-tac-toe,
wide-open skating.

1128
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:28,748
<i>But I'm telling you, some pretty
good goals. I'm loving these kids.</i>

1129
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:30,833
I want to adopt them.
How's that?

1130
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:32,794
I want to clean them up
and raise them as my own.

1131
01:29:32,877 --> 01:29:34,754
Someone who's
not surprised, Brian.

1132
01:29:34,879 --> 01:29:37,715
Donna Biebe,
wife of captain John Biebe.

1133
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,009
- Well, what a period.
- Yes, it was.

1134
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:43,053
What's it like seeing your husband
out there with the New York Rangers?

1135
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:46,556
It's great.
It's something, actually.

1136
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,017
Did you see
your daddy out there?

1137
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,979
I have a toy pony.
He takes big shits.

1138
01:29:53,104 --> 01:29:56,232
Excellent.
Back to you.

1139
01:29:56,315 --> 01:29:58,192
Defensemen...

1140
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:00,944
use each other as outlets.

1141
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,113
<i>- Yes, Coach!
- Hunt in corners!</i>

1142
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:05,782
<i>They're not that good.
We can beat these guys.</i>

1143
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:08,743
<i>- They're not that good!
- You're damn right we can!</i>

1144
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:11,204
Yeah!

1145
01:30:11,329 --> 01:30:12,747
Come on, let's go!

1146
01:30:12,914 --> 01:30:14,415
<i>Ready four? Take four.</i>

1147
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,542
<i>- Come on, Stevie!
- Steven Weeks, on the move.</i>

1148
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:19,128
<i>Carries out
of his own zone.</i>

1149
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:21,797
<i>Look out!
Yeaton rips the head off him!</i>

1150
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:26,176
<i>Weeks over the boards and into
the Ranger bench! Wow!</i>

1151
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:32,432
<i>- Come on!
- And now they help Weeks back onto the ice...</i>

1152
01:30:32,598 --> 01:30:35,893
<i>- in that New York way.
- Give me my stick!</i>

1153
01:30:36,018 --> 01:30:37,853
<i>Man, he's lucky
to get out of there alive.</i>

1154
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,897
<i>Well, the Rangers
have stepped it up, Phil.</i>

1155
01:30:40,022 --> 01:30:42,191
Coach Higgins must have had
one of his screaming fits...

1156
01:30:42,316 --> 01:30:44,192
- between periods.
- Now, look at this.

1157
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:46,319
<i>The Rangers are platooning
back and forth...</i>

1158
01:30:46,486 --> 01:30:48,488
<i>between the warm
dressing room.</i>

1159
01:30:48,655 --> 01:30:50,532
<i>Well, that's something I've never seen.
- That's not legal.</i>

1160
01:30:50,657 --> 01:30:52,825
Is that legal?
That's not legal.

1161
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,036
<i>The Rangers continue the pressure.</i>

1162
01:30:55,161 --> 01:30:57,496
Pick up the man in front!
Pick him up!

1163
01:30:57,621 --> 01:31:00,040
<i>Scores!</i>

1164
01:31:00,207 --> 01:31:02,709
<i>And the Rangers
are finally on the board.</i>

1165
01:31:02,793 --> 01:31:05,378
Let's go, guys.
Let's go!

1166
01:31:05,545 --> 01:31:09,424
<i>Rangers on another rush.
Three on two, wide across the ice.</i>

1167
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:11,676
<i>Back into the slot,
shot, scores!</i>

1168
01:31:11,801 --> 01:31:14,679
<i>The slap shot beats Holt
on the stick side,</i>

1169
01:31:14,804 --> 01:31:17,348
<i>and that ties it up
at two.</i>

1170
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:19,975
<i>Put a body in front of him!</i>

1171
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:23,478
<i>Rangers go back to work now.
Robertson to Wasson.</i>

1172
01:31:23,604 --> 01:31:25,480
<i>There's a move
behind the net to Rourke.</i>

1173
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,482
<i>Apuck shot to...
Shoots and he scores!</i>

1174
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:33,571
- Yeah!
- That's hockey!

1175
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:35,656
<i>It's really
starting to unravel for Mystery.</i>

1176
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,617
<i>They just lost their composure,
and now they are paying for it.</i>

1177
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,161
Rangers take their first lead
of the game, three to two,

1178
01:31:41,328 --> 01:31:44,081
with 12½ minutes left
in the period.

1179
01:31:44,206 --> 01:31:47,334
<i>And back comes Mystery.
Birdie Burns with Biebe.</i>

1180
01:31:47,459 --> 01:31:49,836
<i>Burns shooting!</i>

1181
01:31:50,003 --> 01:31:52,213
<i>- What the fuck was that?
- Biebe torpedoed into the net!</i>

1182
01:31:52,296 --> 01:31:54,507
<i>That sets off
another scuffle.</i>

1183
01:31:54,674 --> 01:31:57,051
<i>Hey, fuck you!</i>

1184
01:31:57,176 --> 01:32:01,472
<i>He's back up
and rejoins the play.</i>

1185
01:32:01,597 --> 01:32:03,599
<i>- Burns carries through centre ice.
- Pass it!</i>

1186
01:32:03,724 --> 01:32:05,809
<i>He's got Banks on the wing. Pass to
the middle. Robertson catches it.</i>

1187
01:32:05,934 --> 01:32:08,895
<i>Oh! What a hit!</i>

1188
01:32:09,062 --> 01:32:11,564
<i>Birdie Burns is caught
trying to do it all by himself...</i>

1189
01:32:11,689 --> 01:32:14,567
<i>and he got his wings trimmed
right there, man.</i>

1190
01:32:14,692 --> 01:32:18,362
Birdie.
You don't pass, you sit.

1191
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:20,823
<i>Now Skank Marden carries out.</i>

1192
01:32:20,906 --> 01:32:23,283
<i>Hooked by Neskorami,
Marden goes down.</i>

1193
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:25,911
<i>- Rangers score!
- What the hell was that?</i>

1194
01:32:26,036 --> 01:32:28,413
<i>- Marden was hooked.
- Are you crazy?</i>

1195
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,458
- How many times are you gonna
let him hook me?

1196
01:32:32,542 --> 01:32:36,087
Back off!
Back off!

1197
01:32:36,295 --> 01:32:41,008
<i>And another Ranger line comes
back warm from the locker room.</i>

1198
01:32:41,175 --> 01:32:43,343
<i>Holt comes out
and sheriff's deputy...</i>

1199
01:32:43,468 --> 01:32:46,012
<i>Bobby Michan goes in at goal.</i>

1200
01:32:46,221 --> 01:32:47,973
<i>Saved!
Michan stacks the pads!</i>

1201
01:32:48,098 --> 01:32:50,225
<i>And Mystery comes
streaking back the other way.</i>

1202
01:32:50,266 --> 01:32:52,643
<i>The Winetkas lead the way.
They gain the zone.</i>

1203
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:55,104
<i>Back over the blue line.
And it's intercepted!</i>

1204
01:32:55,187 --> 01:32:57,648
<i>- Jackson's on a breakaway!
- On center ice.</i>

1205
01:32:57,815 --> 01:33:00,317
<i>- No way.
- And Lane chases.</i>

1206
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:02,861
<i>He... scores!</i>

1207
01:33:02,986 --> 01:33:07,616
<i>Five unanswered goals,
and the Rangers are steamrolling.</i>

1208
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:11,160
<i>- Come on, Mystery!
- Damn!</i>

1209
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:14,789
<i>We'll be right back
with the third period.</i>

1210
01:33:34,891 --> 01:33:36,684
Different story
in the second period.

1211
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:39,520
The Rangers have all the momentum now.
Five straight goals.

1212
01:33:39,687 --> 01:33:43,106
I feel really bad for these boys, Jimmy.
I really do.

1213
01:33:43,273 --> 01:33:46,151
Nobody told them
it was just a show.

1214
01:33:46,318 --> 01:33:49,028
<i>There's still a period to go.
Twenty minutes. Any hope?</i>

1215
01:33:49,195 --> 01:33:54,158
- I hate to say it. They're done like dinner.
- Aw, bullshit.

1216
01:33:54,325 --> 01:33:56,660
Hey, we're on the air.

1217
01:34:07,879 --> 01:34:09,547
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

1218
01:34:09,672 --> 01:34:12,717
We'll get our shots.
We're not out.

1219
01:34:12,842 --> 01:34:15,219
Balls to the walls, huh?

1220
01:34:17,304 --> 01:34:19,348
- You're gonna need some stitches, John.
- After.

1221
01:34:19,473 --> 01:34:22,226
Oh, Jesus. Can't hold a stick.

1222
01:34:31,109 --> 01:34:32,944
It might be broken.

1223
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:36,113
Well, tape it,
'cause I'm not coming out.

1224
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:40,743
- Tape it.
- We'll look at it after the game, all right?

1225
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,959
- You all right, John?
- Yeah.

1226
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:53,546
Here's what I want.
One man in, wings on wings.

1227
01:34:53,713 --> 01:34:57,550
- Nobody pinches. Trap the neutral zone.
- Why? We're down.

1228
01:34:57,675 --> 01:35:01,345
I want to keep the score close. As long
as it's not a rout, we go home winners.

1229
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:05,599
Now, if we gain the zone,
you get across the blue line, you dump.

1230
01:35:05,724 --> 01:35:07,684
- Send in only the first guy.
- What are you talking about?

1231
01:35:07,767 --> 01:35:10,770
- I'm talking about we're beaten.
- We're not beaten.

1232
01:35:10,895 --> 01:35:12,730
I'm not beaten!

1233
01:35:13,981 --> 01:35:17,693
We're in this game!

1234
01:35:17,818 --> 01:35:20,779
- Anybody here
tired? - No. - No.

1235
01:35:20,904 --> 01:35:24,408
- Anybody fuckin' tired?
- No!

1236
01:35:24,574 --> 01:35:26,576
- Holt?
- I'm just warming up, Sheriff.

1237
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,370
- Connor?
- I'm ready, John.

1238
01:35:28,495 --> 01:35:30,205
- Birdie, you with us?
- Yup.

1239
01:35:30,413 --> 01:35:33,499
Good. The Rangers are starting
to breathe through their mouths.

1240
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:35,293
<i>Their strides
are getting shorter.</i>

1241
01:35:35,418 --> 01:35:37,670
Do not give these guys
too much respect.

1242
01:35:37,837 --> 01:35:40,714
<i>- They didn't pull a dog sled, did they?
- No.</i>

1243
01:35:40,839 --> 01:35:43,008
- They didn't skate the river, did they?
- No.

1244
01:35:43,133 --> 01:35:45,760
Forget about that fucking
circus out there.

1245
01:35:45,886 --> 01:35:49,222
That's still black ice.
This is our pond.

1246
01:35:49,347 --> 01:35:51,266
- You're goddamn right.
- That's right.

1247
01:35:51,432 --> 01:35:56,645
- Biebe's right.
We gotta take it to these guys.

1248
01:35:56,771 --> 01:35:58,689
Heads up!

1249
01:36:04,361 --> 01:36:06,321
This is our pond.

1250
01:36:10,909 --> 01:36:12,744
Nice assist.

1251
01:36:14,245 --> 01:36:17,206
<i>- I will. I will.
- We gotta do it together, man.</i>

1252
01:36:26,173 --> 01:36:28,883
<i>Mystery is hoping the cold
of night will stem this Ranger tide.</i>

1253
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:31,636
<i>- Get it, John!
- But the Rangers are right back on the attack.</i>

1254
01:36:33,179 --> 01:36:35,848
<i>Oh!
And a huge hit by Biebe!</i>

1255
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:40,561
<i>It's payback time,
and that one's for Stevie Weeks.</i>

1256
01:36:40,686 --> 01:36:43,313
<i>Face-off on the Rangers'end.
Rangers get the draw.</i>

1257
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,608
<i>Cangrapoole along the boards.
Lane pitches, and the puck squirts free.</i>

1258
01:36:46,691 --> 01:36:49,486
<i>- Jackson's got it!
- Eleven, pick him up!</i>

1259
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:51,654
Come on, boys.
Cover it!

1260
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:54,657
<i>He's gone on the breakaway.
This could really put Mystery away.</i>

1261
01:36:54,824 --> 01:36:57,243
<i>They're chasing,
butJackson's all alone.</i>

1262
01:36:57,451 --> 01:37:02,039
<i>- Come on!
- Jackson fakes and shoots!</i>

1263
01:37:02,122 --> 01:37:04,458
<i>A huge save by Holt!</i>

1264
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:08,003
<i>Holt stood on his head.
I've never seen a save like that!</i>

1265
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:11,589
Great save, Holt.
Come on, guys.

1266
01:37:11,714 --> 01:37:13,674
Come on, Tree. Let's go, baby.
Come on, Galin. Let's go now.

1267
01:37:13,883 --> 01:37:16,177
<i>Face-off at the Mystery
blue line.</i>

1268
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,512
<i>Rangers win the draw.
Back to Rory.</i>

1269
01:37:18,637 --> 01:37:21,098
<i>- And both Winetkas forecheck.
- Take it in!</i>

1270
01:37:21,223 --> 01:37:23,141
<i>Galin knocks the puck to brother Ben
and carries it into the zone.</i>

1271
01:37:23,267 --> 01:37:25,143
<i>Connolly trails.
He has it in his sights.</i>

1272
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:27,979
<i>He shoots...
Scores!</i>

1273
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:32,775
<i>And he rips the shot
over Gainer's glove!</i>

1274
01:37:32,817 --> 01:37:36,362
Yeah! Ha!
Yeah!

1275
01:37:36,529 --> 01:37:39,281
<i>- Goal by 29.
- All right, we're back in it, boys!</i>

1276
01:37:44,369 --> 01:37:46,163
Wow, Johnny!

1277
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:49,999
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Let's go!

1278
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:54,462
<i>That makes it five to three,
and Mystery has a pulse again.</i>

1279
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:57,673
<i>But the Rangers
control the puck.</i>

1280
01:37:57,798 --> 01:38:01,385
<i>Back to Wasson. He winds for the shot.
Marden drops to block.</i>

1281
01:38:01,593 --> 01:38:04,304
<i>- Oh, my god.
Oh, man! Does that gotta hurt!</i>

1282
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:09,100
<i>- Oh, Mommy.
- He really took one in the siege for the team.</i>

1283
01:38:09,225 --> 01:38:11,311
<i>Mystery gets the loose puck
and heads the other way.</i>

1284
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:13,563
<i>Now Marden is slow to get up.</i>

1285
01:38:13,688 --> 01:38:16,232
<i>And Phil, you don't see a guy just
lie down in front of a Billy Wasson...</i>

1286
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:19,318
<i>90-mile-an-hour slap shot
very often.</i>

1287
01:38:19,443 --> 01:38:21,445
<i>Mystery is giving everything
they've got. This is great hockey.</i>

1288
01:38:23,905 --> 01:38:25,824
Everybody in!

1289
01:38:25,907 --> 01:38:27,867
As soon as you cross
the blue line,

1290
01:38:27,993 --> 01:38:30,995
- Holt, you come, Skank, you go.
- Yeah.

1291
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,831
Three men on the puck.
Defense, you gotta pinch!

1292
01:38:33,998 --> 01:38:35,625
Throw it at the net.
Everybody's gotta crash.

1293
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,877
- Come on, let's go!
- Right with you, sir.

1294
01:38:38,002 --> 01:38:40,713
- Hang if you have to, Connor.
- Got it.

1295
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:43,215
Blow it out your ass.

1296
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:45,175
- Plenty of time. Plenty of time. Let's go!
- Come on, guys!

1297
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,970
<i>1:26.
Two goals down.</i>

1298
01:38:49,054 --> 01:38:51,681
- And time is running out for Mystery.
- Desperation time, Doug.

1299
01:38:51,848 --> 01:38:53,724
Look for Burns
to pull their goalie.

1300
01:38:53,808 --> 01:38:56,185
They want to get that extra attacker
into the play.

1301
01:38:56,352 --> 01:39:01,482
Come on! It's not over!
Mystery! Mystery!

1302
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:04,359
<i>- Mystery! Mystery!
- Mystery! Mystery!</i>

1303
01:39:04,568 --> 01:39:06,778
Let's rock, boys.
Let's get it going!

1304
01:39:06,945 --> 01:39:10,865
<i>Mystery! Mystery!</i>

1305
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:13,117
<i>And Banks wins it.
Biebe carries.</i>

1306
01:39:13,242 --> 01:39:15,745
<i>- And there goes Holt.
Six attackers. The net's empty.</i>

1307
01:39:17,872 --> 01:39:20,290
<i>On the wing to Weeks. He gains the zone.</i>

1308
01:39:20,374 --> 01:39:23,460
<i>And here comes Mystery.
Let's see how they work the puck.</i>

1309
01:39:23,627 --> 01:39:27,130
<i>From right wing to right point,
down low to Birdie Burns.</i>

1310
01:39:27,213 --> 01:39:30,383
<i>Here comes Burns, working for a shot.
He's gonna shoot.</i>

1311
01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:32,552
<i>No, he passes the puck
to Biebe! Shoots!</i>

1312
01:39:32,677 --> 01:39:35,388
- Scores!
- Yea!

1313
01:39:35,554 --> 01:39:38,557
<i>Biebe scores off a great pass
from Birdie Burns.</i>

1314
01:39:38,766 --> 01:39:42,686
<i>- Yeah!
- Five to four, Mystery down by one,</i>

1315
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:46,356
<i>and now, 43 seconds to play.</i>

1316
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:50,777
<i>- It's not over yet!
- Who would have ever guessed it would get to this?</i>

1317
01:39:50,944 --> 01:39:56,115
<i>- Did you see that?
- Mystery, Alaska, one goal away from tying the New York Rangers.</i>

1318
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:09,711
Come on!
One more! One more!

1319
01:40:09,878 --> 01:40:12,171
Don't rush the shot.
Three men across the blue line.

1320
01:40:12,338 --> 01:40:14,257
Skank, you in the middle.

1321
01:40:14,382 --> 01:40:17,927
- Yeah.
- Work it down low, look for Connor. Don't rush it.

1322
01:40:17,968 --> 01:40:20,346
Forty-three seconds,

1323
01:40:20,471 --> 01:40:22,556
and then the rest
of your lives.

1324
01:40:22,681 --> 01:40:25,559
Forty-three seconds.
You own that time.

1325
01:40:25,684 --> 01:40:28,061
It's your time.
Am I right?

1326
01:40:28,186 --> 01:40:30,063
- Right on!
- Take it! Take it!

1327
01:40:30,146 --> 01:40:32,523
<i>Mystery's gonna keep
their goalie on the bench.</i>

1328
01:40:32,648 --> 01:40:34,692
<i>Six on five,
with the empty net behind.</i>

1329
01:40:34,817 --> 01:40:37,778
<i>They're going for it.
Everything's on the line!</i>

1330
01:40:37,903 --> 01:40:39,905
<i>This is what this game's
all about.</i>

1331
01:40:40,114 --> 01:40:44,159
<i>Rangers win the draw.
Robertson for the empty net!</i>

1332
01:40:44,326 --> 01:40:46,661
<i>And he just missed it!</i>

1333
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:54,710
Plenty of time!
Plenty of time!

1334
01:40:54,877 --> 01:40:57,004
<i>Biebe slowing it down
behind the net.</i>

1335
01:40:57,088 --> 01:40:59,673
Stay high.
All the way in, Stevie.

1336
01:40:59,757 --> 01:41:01,592
<i>Now Weeks takes it
and carries it on down the wing.</i>

1337
01:41:01,717 --> 01:41:04,970
<i>This kid still has got the jets.
- Yes! Yes!</i>

1338
01:41:05,095 --> 01:41:07,013
<i>They'll be working
to free up Connor Banks in the slot.</i>

1339
01:41:07,138 --> 01:41:11,184
<i>Here comes Mystery.
Banks trying to get free.</i>

1340
01:41:11,309 --> 01:41:13,644
<i>Biebe's got it!
Here comes Connor Banks!</i>

1341
01:41:13,769 --> 01:41:15,813
<i>He's got a shot!</i>

1342
01:43:13,421 --> 01:43:15,256
Wow.

1343
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:08,722
<i>Mystery! Mystery!</i>

1344
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,854
- Good game.
- Good game.

1345
01:44:17,021 --> 01:44:20,065
- Good game.
- Good game.

1346
01:44:20,232 --> 01:44:23,068
Nice game.

1347
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:04,189
Great game, son.

1348
01:45:12,905 --> 01:45:14,782
Great game, Judge.

1349
01:45:33,925 --> 01:45:36,093
- Stevie!
- Hey.

1350
01:45:36,218 --> 01:45:38,429
- I can't believe you're leaving.
- I know.

1351
01:45:42,349 --> 01:45:44,184
We never even had sex.

1352
01:45:46,311 --> 01:45:48,396
I'll be back
in a couple of months.

1353
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,773
You better.

1354
01:45:55,278 --> 01:45:57,780
- For real?
- Can you believe it?

1355
01:46:01,575 --> 01:46:03,619
- Oh, man!
- Yeah, I know.

1356
01:46:03,744 --> 01:46:05,787
Your little garden
is gonna have fun.

1357
01:46:05,912 --> 01:46:08,415
There's some serious turnip to hoe
in New York City.

1358
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:11,000
I'm not going to the New York Rangers
right away.

1359
01:46:11,167 --> 01:46:14,420
They're sending me to Binghamton,
which is like the AHL.

1360
01:46:14,503 --> 01:46:17,131
Yeah!

1361
01:46:17,339 --> 01:46:19,425
- Stevie Weeks too?
- Yeah.

1362
01:46:19,591 --> 01:46:21,635
Both to Binghamton, huh?
Two-way contracts.

1363
01:46:21,718 --> 01:46:23,637
To start with.
They'll make it.

1364
01:46:23,762 --> 01:46:26,223
They won't be coming back.

1365
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:29,017
Shame they couldn't take
Skank with them, huh?

1366
01:46:29,184 --> 01:46:31,436
Well, good for you, John. You'll be
back in the Saturday game then.

1367
01:46:31,519 --> 01:46:34,355
Uh-huh. Yeah. Until you can
find a way to bump me again.

1368
01:46:38,734 --> 01:46:40,819
All right, folks.
Gotta go.

1369
01:46:40,944 --> 01:46:43,196
Love to stay,
but, uh, gotta go.

1370
01:46:43,322 --> 01:46:45,198
- You're not going on the helicopter?
- No.

1371
01:46:45,365 --> 01:46:48,952
There's no room on that thing. I got
a car waiting to take me to Fairbanks.

1372
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:52,288
- Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

1373
01:46:52,413 --> 01:46:54,248
Thank you.

1374
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:03,674
Yeah.

1375
01:47:03,799 --> 01:47:05,801
I'm gonna say goodbye
to Connor.

1376
01:47:11,973 --> 01:47:13,933
He's a...

1377
01:47:14,058 --> 01:47:15,935
You got a great
family there.

1378
01:47:17,353 --> 01:47:20,439
- I do.
- Yeah.

1379
01:47:20,564 --> 01:47:24,026
Well, we don't have to say goodbye,
really. I hope to be back in June.

1380
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:26,236
Don't bring the Yankees.

1381
01:47:45,378 --> 01:47:47,380
I love you.

1382
01:47:47,505 --> 01:47:49,382
Bye.

1383
01:47:49,549 --> 01:47:51,342
Bye.

1384
01:47:54,512 --> 01:47:56,389
John.

1385
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:22,204
<i>Bye.</i>

1386
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:07,412
So that blocked shot
must have really hurt, huh?

1387
01:49:08,913 --> 01:49:11,207
Not too bad.

1388
01:49:11,332 --> 01:49:15,002
'Cause I have three hours
till my crew's ready to leave.
